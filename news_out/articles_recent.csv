[서울=뉴스핌] 배상희 기자 = 중국 주요 증권∙경제 전문 매체들은 금주(8월11일~8월17일) 중국증시와 관련해 눈여겨볼 만한 소식으로 △7월 소비∙생산∙투자 실물경제 지표 공개 △연내 남하자금 유입액, 최초 9천억 HKD 돌파 △다채로운 로봇 산업 관련 이벤트 봇물 등을 꼽았다.

◆ 7월 소비∙생산∙투자 실물경제 지표 공개

1. 15일 국가통계국은 △제조업 동향 지표인 공업증가치(산업생산) △전자상거래∙백화점∙슈퍼마켓∙일반 소매점 등의 매출을 합산한 사회소비품소매총액(소매판매) △부동산∙제조업∙인프라 경기를 보여주는 고정자산투자 등 중국의 전반적인 경기동향 파악할 수 있는 실물경제 지표의 7월분 데이터를 공개할 예정.

2. 6월 사회소비품소매총액의 전년 동기 대비 증가율은 4.8%로 둔화. 특히, 6월 외식업 매출이 전년 동기 대비 0.9% 증가하는데 그쳐, 전달(5.9%) 대비 크게 둔화됨.

6월 공업증가치는 6.8% 상승. 특히 신에너지차와 공업용 로봇 생산량 증가 속도가 확대. 6월에는 41개 대분류 산업 중 36개 산업의 증가율이 전년 동기 대비 상승함. 그 중 전기기계 및 기기 제조업, 컴퓨터∙통신 및 기타 전자기기 제조업의 생산량이 빠르게 상승.

◆ 연내 남하자금 유입액, 최초 9천억 HKD 돌파

1. 올해 들어 중국 본토 A주에서 홍콩증시로 유입되는 투자금을 의미하는 남하자금(南下資金∙남향자금으로도 불림, 중국 본토 A주에서 홍콩증시로 유입되는 자금)이 최초로 9000억 홍콩달러(HKD, 약 160조원)를 돌파. 중국 본토 투자자들의 홍콩증시에 대한 관심을 방증.

2. 지난주(8월 4일~8월 8일) 남향자금 순유입 규모는 217억5100만 HKD로, 전주 대비 63.15% 감소함. 다만, 올해 들어 누적 순유입액은 9008억 HKD를 기록하며 최초로 9000억 HKD를 넘어섬.

3. 중은국제(中銀國際) 연구보고서는 강구퉁(港股通, 상하이와 선전 증권거래소를 통한 홍콩 주식 거래) 제도가 지속적으로 심화되면서, 남하자금이 홍콩 증시의 중요한 추가 자금원으로 자리잡았다고 분석함. 특히, 중국 본토 자본을 배경으로 둔 중국테마주(中概股, 해외 시장에 상장한 중국기업 종목) 중에서도 신경제(新經濟, ICT 기술을 기반으로 생산성을 높이는 경제) 방향에 부합하는 종목과 섹터로의 자금 유입세 뚜렷.

4. 거래 순매수 금액 기준으로 보면, 대다수 대형 기술주로 남하자금의 유입 확대.

그 중 알리바바(9988.HK)의 경우 지난주 남하자금 순매수액이 33억3900만 HKD로 가장 높아. 알리바바는 4주 연속 남하자금 보유량이 증가했으며, 최신 보유 주식 수는 15억7900만 주로 홍콩 증시 전체 발행주식수의 8.26%를 차지함. 이밖에 텐센트홀딩스(0700.HK), 샤오미(1810.HK), SMIC(0981.HK) 역시 같은 기간 10억 HKD 이상의 순매수액을 기록함.

中国平安（601318.SH、2318.HK）、华为、比亚迪（002594.SZ、1211.HK）、腾讯（0700.HK）、招商银行（600036.SH、3968.HK）、万科（2202.HK）、顺丰（002352.SZ）、深投控8家深企进入前100名单，其中，中国平安排名第13位，也是粤港澳大湾区中排名最高的企业；腾讯、中国平安上榜最赚钱的企业前十名，今年新上榜有永道控股集团、瑞声科技（2018.HK）、广深铁路股份（601333.SH、0525.HK）3家企业。

从行业分布看，深圳上榜企业呈多元布局且聚焦新兴产业，尤其是新能源企业表现亮眼，比亚迪相较去年排名上升13名，跻身深企前三，欣旺达（300207.SZ）、格林美（002340.SZ）等新能源细分领域企业排名也大幅提升，分别提升33、43名。此外，依托深圳多年来在消费电子、智能制造的产业优势，鹏鼎控股（002938.SZ）、传音控股（688036.SH）、汇川技术（300124.SZ）等企业排名相较去年大幅提升。

事实上，从上榜中国500强的深企行业构成和排名变化中，可以一窥深圳经济发展的新动能、新风向。

今年500家上榜的中国公司在2024年的总营业收入达到14.2万亿美元；净利润达到7564亿美元，较上年增长约7%。

深圳共有8家企业进入前100名单，包括中国平安、华为、比亚迪、腾讯、招商银行、万科、顺丰和深投控，也是粤港澳大湾区中上榜企业数量最多的城市。

其中，中国平安排名第13位，也是粤港澳大湾区中排名最高的企业，2024年营业收入达1586.27亿美元，利润达175.96亿美元。

尽管中国平安主业是金融，但在新一轮科技浪潮叙事下，企业同样注重人工智能前沿领域的科技投入。据平安集团年报，2024年，平安研发费用达180亿元，拥有2.1万名科技开发人员及3000名科学家。目前人工智能已在平安主业的各个环节全面铺开，2024年中国平安AI坐席服务量约18.4亿次，覆盖平安80%的客服总量。

与中国平安一样上榜榜单上最赚钱的前十企业还有腾讯。榜单显示，腾讯2024年的净利润同比增长超过65%，以超过269亿美元的净利润排在利润榜第6位。

目前，腾讯正通过战略性投资布局文娱传媒、游戏、人工智能等多个领域，投资板块曾一度贡献腾讯三分之一利润。依托微信生态内的丰富应用场景，腾讯正持续加码AI产业，其AI战略也正进入重投入期。

华为在深圳榜单中位列第二，面临外部挑战，依靠强大的研发实力，企业自主研发出全栈芯片及原生鸿蒙操作系统，在智能汽车、终端业务等板块均呈现出强势增长势头。去年华为全球销售收入8621亿元，营收同比增长22.42%，营收实现华为史上第二高，增速也相比上一年明显加速。

据统计，2024年华为研发投入达1797亿元，约占全年收入的20.8%。截至2024年底，研发员工约11.3万名，占总员工数量的54.1%，在全球共持有有效授权专利超过15万件。

深耕新能源汽车领域的比亚迪，今年排名相较去年上升13名。近年来其全球化布局全面提速，业务遍及全球6大洲、110多个国家和地区，2024年全球累计销售新能源汽车427.21万辆，蝉联全球新能源车市场销量冠军。2024年，比亚迪研发投入金额达542亿元，占营业收入6.97%，走出产业与科技相互支撑的路径。

值得关注的是，上述四家引领行业发展的深圳巨头企业，也被业内誉为深圳创新""四姐妹""，正依托自身的科研技术影响力，构建起产业与科技双轮驱动的复合型创新生态体系。

截至7月23日收盘，腾讯控股（0700.HK）、比亚迪（1211.HK）、中国平安（2318.HK）总市值分别为5.06万亿港元、1.17万亿港元、1.09万亿港元。

深圳上榜企业中，有3家企业为首次上榜，分别是永道控股集团、瑞声科技和广深铁路股份。港股上市的瑞声科技在微型声学、精密光学等多个领域全球市场份额领先，2024年，瑞声科技营收273.3亿元，归母净利润为17.97亿元，同比增长142.7%。

广深铁路股份作为沪港两地上市企业，独立经营的深圳 -- 广州 -- 坪石铁路，营业里程481公里，纵向贯通广东省全境。今年一季度，广深铁路股份营业收入达68.96亿元，同比增长4.47%。

今年也有不少公司排名大幅上升，如汇川技术从去年的456名上升到今年的377名，上升79个名次，是今年深圳名单中排名提升最多的企业。格林美从去年的454名上升到今年的411名，鹏鼎控股从去年的437名上升到今年的397名。

从深圳上榜企业行业分布来看，产业结构多元且优化，入围企业覆盖电子信息、新能源、人工智能、现代物流、金融投资、银行与保险、生物医药等多个领域。

根据榜单，华为、中国电子、中兴通讯分别位列第24名、第105名、第187名，年利润均超过10亿美元，这些企业都是连年上榜，

这也是深圳电子信息产业发展的一个缩影。深圳是全球电子信息产业重镇，目前，深圳规上电子信息制造企业超过4100家，2023年产值达2.52万亿元，占全国六分之一，多年稳居内地城市首位。

以电子信息产业为支柱，深圳正滚动发展""20+8""产业集群，抢抓新能源、智能网联汽车、具身智能机器人等产业新风口，提升产业竞争力。

2024年，深圳规上工业总产值超5.4万亿元，规上工业增加值同比增长9.7%，连续3年稳居中国""工业第一城""。

在榜单中，新能源领域企业表现亮眼，尤其是在新型储能、动力电池等细分领域。主营动力电池回收和新能源材料制造的格林美今年排名上升43个名次。采取资本并购、合资建厂、海外上市融资等多种形式进行全球化布局是格林美的核心竞争力。近期，格林美与韩国最大NCA正极材料公司ECOPRO达成协议共建印尼IGIP园区，韩国也将成为格林美链接欧美客户的中转站。

在榜单中从去年的332名前进到今年的299名的欣旺达，跻身全球动力电池装机量前十、中国企业全球储能电芯出货量前十，储能系统（直流侧）全球市场出货量前五。2024年公司营收突破560亿元，动力电池、储能业务增速分别超40%、70%。

当前，深圳正加快发展人工智能与机器人产业。值得注意的是，欣旺达也是3C消费类电池领域的隐形冠军，目前正在进行机器人电池突围，通过聚合物固态电解质路线切入人形机器人领域，其提供的固态电池已在GoMate项目中实现搭载，并在量产推进中。

另外，同样有布局机器人业务的汇川技术则是在深圳榜单中排名进步最为显著的企业。目前，汇川技术机器人产品系列不断完善，2024年，企业正式布局人形机器人业务，启动高性能关节部件样机等部分核心零部件研发工作。2024年全年，汇川技术营业总收入同比增长22%，营业净利润达42.9亿元。

不过，在关注上榜企业的同时，也需要看到，作为全国创业密度高的城市，深圳在新经济风口抢抓机遇，企业在新兴产业赛道上发力，榜单外追逐新动能的深企依然潜力无限。

有如在机器人领域，近期，逐际动力获得京东战略领投，众擎机器人完成近10亿元两轮融资，优必选斩获9051万元全球最大人形机器人订单；今年上半年，深圳集成电路产业规模达1424亿元，同比增长16.9%，产业链上包括江波龙、佰维存储、德明利、天德钰、中科蓝讯等企业正通过产业协同进行技术突破与提升。

未来，《财富》榜单里的深企队伍持续扩大仍值得期待。",zho,21jingji.com,2025-07-23T09:46:38Z,2025-07-23,09:46:38
2025-08-813014624,https://www.reuters.com/sports/saudi-backed-esports-foundation-debut-nations-cup-riyadh-next-year-2025-08-23/,Saudi-backed esports foundation to debut Nations Cup in Riyadh next year,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed foundation behind the Esports World Cup is betting on national pride to fuel its next phase of growth with a new biennial tournament starting next year.

The Esports Nations Cup will debut at the end of 2026 in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, the Esports World Cup (EWC) Foundation said on Saturday, without naming the participants.

Unlike the annual world cup with its club-based format, the new tournament will feature national teams and be held every two years.

The cup is part of Saudi's ""Vision 2030"" strategy to diversify beyond oil, with big investments in gaming and other sports, among other sectors. Critics have, however, called the push ""sportswashing"" due to the country's human rights record.

""There is much more potential to grow. There is a void in national representation and national pride will bring additional fans and players and cultural engagement,"" Ralf Reichert, the foundation's CEO, told Reuters.

Reichert said the prize pool would be ""comparable"" to the $70 million lot for the Esports World Cup's second edition, set for its finale on Sunday.

Its hours watched have jumped 52% to 270 million over the inaugural edition, while over 2 million have attended in person.

Such tournaments are crucial for pro-gamers as prominent esports brands struggle with finances. Some of the tournaments have also included post-pandemic favorites such as chess.

For ENC, the foundation has partnered with video game publishers Electronic Arts (EA.O), opens new tab, Krafton (259960.KS), opens new tab, Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab and Ubisoft (UBIP.PA), opens new tab.

""(The publishers) have the data on what's happening on the server. So identifying in each country who are the best players ... then figuring out who's the national coach will be done together with a publisher,"" Reichert said.

For future editions, the host cities will rotate to ""where the sport is popular and can mobilize the masses,"" he added.

2025-08-811964270,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/starbucks-expects-non-binding-bids-china-business-within-two-weeks-sources-say-2025-08-22/,"Starbucks expects non-binding bids for China business within two weeks, sources say","HONG KONG, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Starbucks (SBUX.O), opens new tab has asked a short-listed group of potential bidders to submit non-binding bids for a stake in its China business within the next two weeks, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

The U.S. coffee shop chain invited interested parties including private equity firms Carlyle (CG.O), opens new tab, EQT (EQTAB.ST), opens new tab, Hillhouse Investment and Primavera Capital to attend management presentations where it would disclose financial and operational details of its China business, said one of the people as well as a third person with knowledge of the presentations.

Other potential bidders include Bain Capital, KKR & Co (KKR.N), opens new tab and technology major Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab, said one of the first two sources and two other people familiar with the matter.

A new partner in China could add impetus to a business whose market share has more than halved in the past five years, as low-price local rivals grow apace while consumers become increasingly cost-conscious in a stuttering economy.

In May this year, Starbucks began the sale by inviting interested parties to answer questions about their businesses by late June, Reuters previously reported.

The Seattle-based company said at the time it was not considering a full sale of the business - which bidders expect will be valued at up to $10 billion, CNBC reported citing sources.

In July, it selected up to 10 interested parties and signed non-disclosure agreements ahead of granting potential access to financial and operational figures, the five people said.

It has yet to finalise the structure of the sale or size of the stake, said the people, who declined to be identified as the information was not public.

The cafe chain has held informal talks with a range of potential buyers since the second half of last year and aims to reach a deal by year-end, sources previously told Reuters.

CEO Brian Niccol on Starbuck's quarterly earnings call last month said the cafe chain had received interest from more than 20 parties and was evaluating options.

""We remain committed to our China business and want to retain a meaningful stake... We will only enter a transaction if it makes sense for Starbucks,"" said Niccol, CEO since August last year.

Starbucks on Friday declined to comment further.

Primavera, Carlyle, EQT, KKR and Bain declined to comment. Hillhouse and Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.

Starbucks is pursuing the sale after reporting strong overall revenue for the three months through June 29 under a turnaround plan Niccol implemented after several quarters of falling earnings.

Net revenue rose 3.8% to $9.46 billion, slightly exceeding the average analyst estimate, though same-store sales fell for a sixth consecutive quarter, by 2%.

In China, Starbucks faces sluggish economic growth and competition from local brands such as Luckin Coffee (LC0Ay.D), opens new tab, which has gained market share with cheaper products and greater presence in smaller cities.

Starbucks' market share in the world's second-largest economy - home to more than a fifth of its cafes - was 14% last year versus 34% in 2019, showed data from market researcher Euromonitor International.

The chain has since taken the rare step of reducing prices for some non-coffee drinks in China and increased the pace of new and China-centric product innovation.

Comparable-store sales in China increased 2% in the quarter ended June 29 versus zero growth in the previous quarter.

Starbucks operated 7,828 stores in China as at June-end, its latest quarterly report showed. It did not disclose core earnings at its China business.

POURQUOI LA PROPRIÉTÉ INTELLECTUELLE DES CONTENUS ASIATIQUES GAGNE DES AUDIENCES MONDIALES

Alors que la distribution sur Internet devient de plus en plus banalisée et que la croissance de la consommation mondiale de médias ralentit, les analystes de Bernstein affirment que l'accent se déplace vers un contenu différencié de première partie IP (propriété intellectuelle).

Dans ce contexte, les créateurs de contenu asiatiques, en particulier au Japon, en Corée et en Chine, gagnent en importance au niveau mondial, non seulement en raison de la résonance culturelle, mais aussi en raison des avantages structurels en termes de coûts et de productivité.

Selon Bernstein, les sociétés occidentales de médias et de jeux sont confrontées à des coûts de production plus élevés, ce qui conduit souvent à des stratégies de contenu plus conservatrices.

Les studios ont tendance à s'appuyer sur des suites et des franchises établies, ce qui limite la prise de risque créative et contribue aux signes de lassitude chez les jeunes publics, en particulier avec les anciennes propriétés intellectuelles telles que Marvel et Assassin's Creed, notent les analystes.

Les studios asiatiques, en revanche, peuvent se permettre de prendre davantage de risques créatifs en raison des coûts de main-d'œuvre moins élevés. Ils peuvent essayer de nouvelles idées, itérer plus rapidement et absorber les échecs plus facilement, car chaque heure de travail coûte moins cher.

Au fil du temps, cette approche fondée sur l'essai et l'erreur a plus de chances de déboucher sur des succès retentissants et sur une propriété intellectuelle de grande qualité.

Le Labubu de Pop Mart 9992.HK en est un excellent exemple: ce qui n'était au départ qu'un objet de collection de niche est devenu un symbole de statut parmi les jeunes consommateurs.

Mercredi, le directeur général de Pop Mart, Wang Ning, a déclaré que son entreprise de jouets était en bonne voie pour atteindre son objectif de 20 milliards de yuans (2,78 milliards de dollars) en 2025, et que ""30 milliards de yuans (4,18 milliards de dollars) cette année devraient également être assez faciles"", ce qui souligne le succès commercial de ce type de propriété intellectuelle.

Le rapport souligne également l'empreinte mondiale croissante des médias asiatiques.

Les contenus non anglophones représentent désormais plus de la moitié du catalogue américain de Netflix NFLX.O , la Corée, le Japon et l'Espagne devenant des sources clés de programmes originaux. Des titres tels que Squid Game, One Piece, Demon Slayer et KPop Demon Hunters de Sony ont connu un succès bien au-delà de leurs marchés nationaux, reflétant l'attrait mondial de la propriété intellectuelle asiatique innovante.

""Les industries des médias et des jeux vidéo se sont consolidées au fil du temps, et nous nous attendons à ce que les principales plateformes comme Tencent 0700.HK , Sony 6758.T , Netflix - et les créateurs de contenu comme Nintendo 7974.T et autres - continuent à connaître le succès"", ont déclaré les analystes.

""Comme pour les jeux vidéo, nous nous attendons à ce que l'IA joue un rôle croissant dans l'accélération de la production de contenu médiatique"".

2025-08-810078787,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tencent-backed-developer-unveils-follow-up-hit-black-myth-wukong-2025-08-20/,Tencent-backed developer unveils follow-up to hit 'Black Myth: Wukong',"BEIJING, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Game Science, backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab, surprised games enthusiasts on Wednesday by releasing a trailer for a follow-up to last year's smash hit ""Black Myth: Wukong"".

The new action role-playing game, ""Black Myth: Zhong Kui"", is the second entry in the ""Black Myth"" series, inspired by a mythical ghost-catching figure in ancient Chinese folklore, Game Science said.

The less than two-minute trailer features Zhong Kui, an imposing red-bearded character, riding a majestic tiger with two demons carrying a giant sword.

The video has so far racked up over nine million clicks on Bilibili , a Chinese online video sharing website. It was simultaneously debuted during Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase in Germany's Cologne, where highly-anticipated upcoming gaming titles were presented.

Game Science did not say when it would launch the game and no in-game footage was made available as the project is still in early development, the company said on X.

Fans voiced excitement on Chinese social media following the success of ""Black Myth: Wukong"", which depicted the magical monkey king from the Ming Dynasty epic ""Journey to the West"".

Some, however, were perplexed why the developer chose to embark on a new project while many are still waiting for new downloadable content (DLC) for the Wukong game.

Game Science founder Feng Ji responded on Weibo: ""A DLC would certainly be a good option, but at this moment, what we really want is to create a brand-new Black Myth game - with new heroes, new gameplay, new visuals, new technology and a new story.""

Game Science revealed the first gameplay footage of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" exactly five years ago, attracting millions of views and thrusting the then little-known studio into the limelight. Wukong was officially released on August 20, 2024.

The game topped Steam's most-played games chart with 1.4 million concurrent player hours after its release and went on to sell millions of copies.

Wukong has been widely lauded as China's first AAA game - projects with high development costs, long production cycles and immense investment. It has ignited strong interest in more such games from China and been applauded by Beijing as a way of promoting Chinese culture.

8822873311,https://gcn.com/china-warns-tech-firms-on-nvidia-h20-chip-purchases/5777/,"China warns tech firms on Nvidia H20 AI chip purchases, sources say","The Chinese government has recently taken a firmer position on the use of Nvidia H20 chips, focusing on safeguarding the nation's technological security. By seeking detailed justifications from companies, authorities aim to minimize risks tied to the transfer of sensitive information to overseas parties. This move unfolds amid a climate of escalating geopolitical friction within the semiconductor industry.

Chinese authorities have summoned domestic companies including major internet firms Tencent 9888.HK and ByteDance over their purchases of Nvidia's NVDA.O H20 chips, asking them to explain their reasons and expressed concerns over information risks, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and other agencies also held meetings with Baidu 0700.HK and smaller Chinese tech firms in recent weeks, said one of the two people and a third source.

The discussions underscored that the primary objective is for the national industry to favor domestic suppliers, reinforcing the country's internal supply network. This approach not only seeks to safeguard critical information but also to foster the growth of homegrown artificial intelligence technologies.

The Chinese officials asked companies why they needed to buy Nvidia chips when they could purchase from domestic suppliers, the sources. Authorities also expressed concerns that materials Nvidia has asked companies to submit for U.S. government review could contain sensitive information including client data, one of the sources said.

However, the people, who declined to be identified because the meetings were not public, said the companies have not been ordered to stop buying H20 chips.

Nvidia said on Tuesday the H20 chip was ""not a military product or for government infrastructure"".

""China has ample supply of domestic chips to meet its needs. It won't and never has relied on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China,"" the statement said.

The Chinese government's stance highlights a dual strategy: maintaining strict oversight of foreign technology while emphasizing the capability of its domestic semiconductor industry. By framing the H20 chip as unnecessary for state-related operations, authorities reinforce both the narrative of technological self-sufficiency and the importance of controlling potential data exposure in strategic sectors.

Several companies were issued official notices discouraging the use of the H20, a less-advanced chip, mainly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

In a separate report, The Information reported that ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent had been ordered by the CAC in the past two weeks to suspend Nvidia chip purchases altogether, citing data security concerns.

Nvidia designed the H20 specifically for China after U.S. export restrictions on its more advanced AI chips took effect in late 2023. The H20 had since been the most sophisticated AI chip Nvidia was allowed to sell in China. Earlier this year, U.S. authorities effectively banned its sale to China, but reversed the decision in July following an agreement between Nvidia and the Trump administration.

Last month, China's cyberspace regulator summoned Nvidia representatives, asking the company to explain whether the H20 posed backdoor security risks that could affect Chinese user data and privacy.

The Chinese government's stance indicates that even with the reversal of US restrictions, there is still much to discuss and align with foreign semiconductor companies. H20 is just one example of how political issues can suddenly alter market parameters. Now, for Nvidia, it's crucial to understand how to adapt its products to the Chinese reality in order to maintain its significant presence in the country.",eng,Global Current News,2025-08-19T16:16:56Z,2025-08-19,16:16:56

Several companies were issued official notices discouraging the use of the H20, a less-advanced chip, mainly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The guidance to suspend or avoid H2O purchases comes at a time of regulatory transition, as Chinese companies assess the impact of the easing of restrictions on American exports. At the same time, the government seeks to ensure that potential breaches do not compromise its data protection policy.

In a separate report, The Information reported that ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent had been ordered by the CAC in the past two weeks to suspend Nvidia chip purchases altogether, citing data security concerns.

The CAC directive was communicated at a meeting the regulator held with over a dozen Chinese tech firms, shortly after the Trump administration reversed the export curbs on H20 chips, according to the Information report.

But even without an outright ban, the concerns expressed by Chinese authorities could threaten Nvidia's recently restored access to the Chinese market as Chinese companies look to keep in step with regulators. Nvidia designed the H20 specifically for China after U.S. export restrictions on its more advanced AI chips took effect in late 2023. The H20 had since been the most sophisticated AI chip Nvidia was allowed to sell in China.

Tencent's target price consensus has jumped by more than 5% to HK$688 since it reported quarterly results on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg calculations. That is the second biggest post-earnings jump in its price target over the past five years, beaten only by a March shift fueled by optimism around AI start-up DeepSeek.

【资料图】

8月13日港股收盘后不久，腾讯（0700.HK）发布了2025年二季度以及上半年财报，数据相当惊艳。

二季度，腾讯完成营收1845亿元，同比增长14.5%，这是腾讯连续三个季度营收增幅超过10%，这表明大体量的腾讯依旧保持较高速度增长。

其中增值业务收入914亿元，同比增长16%；本土游戏收入404亿元，增长17%；海外游戏收入188亿元，大增35%；游戏业务合计收入592亿元。社交网络收入322亿元，增长6%。

营销服务收入增长20%至358亿元，主要是AI驱动广告平台改进；金融科技及企业服务收入增长10%，至555亿元，在三大业务中增长最慢。另有业务收入大约18亿元，减少7%，占比1%左右，对腾讯大盘子影响甚微。

毛利率依旧是增长业务最高，达到60%；营销服务默毛利率58%，金融科技和企业毛利率52%，其他毛利率14%，整体毛利率达到57%，比去年同期增加4个百分点。

二季度毛利增长22%至1050亿元，并最终实现盈利556亿元，增长16%，比收入增幅多1.5个百分点。

2025年上半年，腾讯完成收入3645亿元，增长13.7%，其中游戏吸金1187亿元，占总收入大约33%；上半年实现净利润1034亿元，增长15.6%，比收入增长多大约2个百分点，创下历史新高，也是首次半年净利润超过千亿元。

上半年，微信活跃用户还在增长，月均为14.11亿，同比增长3%，环比增长900万人；差不多每个中国人人均有一个活跃微信账号。

再看一下资本开支，二季度资本开支191亿元，比去年同期增加120%；上半年资本开支466亿元，增加超过1倍；投入增量主要就是放在AI端。

前文说到腾讯银行，以国内实力第五强的招行（600036）为例，一季度实现净利润373亿元，减少2%；假如二季度能稳住，净利润不再下滑，和去年同期持平，大约为367亿元，合计上半年招行净利润大约是740亿元上下，比腾讯净利润上半年要少近300亿元。

如果腾讯继续保持两位数增长，其净利润将在2026年超过四大行之一的中国银行（601988）。

在二级市场上，腾讯8月13日大涨4.7%，收于586港元/股，创下年内新高，2025年初至今，腾讯股价累计上涨40.5%，谁说大象不能起舞呢？

8月13日，据腾讯（0700.HK）发布二季度最新财报显示，其二季度总收入1845亿元，同比增长15%；经营利润（Non-IFRS）692亿元，同比增长18%。

AI已成为此次财报的关键词。腾讯CEO马化腾表示，腾讯在AI领域持续投入并从中获益，收入及非国际财务报告准则经营盈利均取得双位数百分比同比增长。""我们致力于通过赋能微信内更多应用场景，推动AI原生应用元宝的使用量，升级我们混元基础模型的能力，为用户及企业带来更进一步的AI增益。""

谈AI：不打算单纯通过市场投放获取新用户

财报显示，腾讯持续加码AI投入。二季度腾讯研发投入达202.5亿元，同比增长17%；资本开支191.1亿元，同比增幅达119%。

AI大模型圈曾经掀起""投流大战""，是否投流长期以来都是大模型行业的命题之一。据腾讯高管在电话会议中表示，曾经为了产品推广进行高额投入。这带来用户的大幅增长。二季度的重点是优化产品，更好地留住已经获取到的大量用户。

谈到未来的计划，腾讯高管称，不打算单纯通过市场投放砸钱来获取新用户。把元宝和现有平台深度整合，这将成为一项关键的竞争力，接下来几个月会不断深化这种整合。同时，也会适时加大产品的市场推广力度。

财报显示，二季度看到GPU（算力）和API Token租赁带来的收入增长，""过去两到三年内，我们有针对性地优化了云业务，削减了低毛利和低附加值的活动。现在已经将云业务运营在一个更可持续的基础之上，供应链的成本竞争力也得到提升，因此能将重心重新放在更快的营收增长节奏上，而不会过于依赖GPU供给的短期波动。""

腾讯高管称，如果GPU供应充足，未来会进一步提升云计算中的GPU租赁，但云业务战略并不仅仅依赖于GPU，在CPU、存储、数据库、CDN等方向都会持续扩展。

而对于供应链端可能带来的挑战，腾讯高管在电话会议中表示，已经拥有足够芯片来进行基础模型的训练和持续迭代，同时在推理芯片的供应渠道侧我们也具备多种选择。也正通过软件优化和升级以提升推理效率，从而在同等芯片数量下承载更高的负载。

从财报来看，腾讯此次财报业绩突出，得益于各业务板块表现出色，以及AI给业务带来的加成。

数据显示，腾讯增值服务收入同比增长16%至913.7亿元，游戏板块收入同比增长22%，其中国际游戏市场收入同比增长35%至188亿元，连续四季创新高。

营销服务在大模型技术升级和微信生态活跃度提升带动下保持高速增长，收入同比增长20%至357.6亿元；金融科技及企业服务业务收入同比增长10%至555.4亿元。

谈3A游戏：要做到""卓越""门槛很高

值得注意的是，AI和广告的融合在二季度给腾讯带来大幅营收增长。

据腾讯高管表示，人工智能带来更精准的定向投放，从而提升点击率。在流量方面，AI带来视频号和搜索流量的增长，未来AI原生应用内的体验也将带来新的流量。

此外，使用生成式AI制作广告素材带来更多的广告需求；电商闭环交易的增多也同样带来更多广告需求，这两者共同推高了单次点击的收入。在广告加载率方面，目前短视频广告加载率仅为中低个位数（如3%-6%），同行的水平则在10%-15%左右，有较大空间。

在核心业务游戏方面，腾讯在今年二季度收入同比增长16%至914亿元，本土市场游戏收入为404亿元，同比增长17%，受益于近期发布的《三角洲行动》的收入贡献，以及《王者荣耀》《无畏契约》《和平精英》等长青游戏的收入增长。

国际市场游戏收入为188亿元，同比增长35%，得益于Supercell旗下游戏及《PUBG MOBILE》的收入增长，以及新发布的《沙丘：觉醒》的收入贡献。社交网络收入同比增长6%至322亿元，得益于手游虚拟道具销售、视频号直播服务收入及音乐付费会员收入的增长。

谈到3A游戏目前在国内市场的表现，腾讯高管表示，中国这类产品受众正在不断扩大，只要做出真正优秀的3A游戏，是有机会实现稳固的盈利，不过想做到""卓越""的门槛很高，目前3A级或买断制游戏在中国市场仍将是少数，但它们在中国的崛起为一些原本不具经济效益的、激情创作的项目提供了极好的机会，使其不依赖于持续的内容和服务，就能具备经济可行性。。",zho,东方财富网,2025-08-14T01:21:54Z,2025-08-14,01:21:54

""We don't really have a definitive answer on the import situation yet. There are a lot of discussions between the two governments. We are waiting to see what exactly comes out of that,"" Tencent President Martin Lau said during a post-earnings call.

The comments come amid ongoing tensions over advanced semiconductor trade between the world's two largest economies. Nvidia(NVDA.O), opens new tab's H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, have been at the center of recent regulatory scrutiny from both governments over security concerns.

Lau said the uncertainty would not constrain Tencent's AI ambitions, noting the company has adequate chip supplies for AI model training and multiple deployment options for AI services.

The Shenzhen-based company reported strong second-quarter results, with revenue rising 15% to 184.5 billion yuan ($25.7 billion), beating analyst estimates of 178.5 billion yuan according to LSEG data.

Gaming remained a key growth driver, with domestic revenue rising 17% to 40.4 billion yuan and international revenue climbing 35% to 18.8 billion yuan.

Marketing services revenue increased 20% year-on-year to 35.8 billion yuan, bolstered by the use of AI to enhance the targeting of adverts.

Net profit for the quarter reached 55.6 billion yuan, surpassing analyst expectations of 52.3 billion yuan, LSEG data showed.

Tencent has accelerated AI investments over the past two years, though capital expenditure has moderated recently. After spending 36.6 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 27.5 billion yuan in the first quarter, its capex fell to 19.1 billion yuan in the second quarter.

Lau signaled a more measured approach going forward as the company seeks sustainable monetization from its AI initiatives and to ""spend smartly"".

The company has developed its own large language model, Hunyuan, launching the latest ""Turbo S"" version in February.

But Tencent has also embraced third-party models, notably integrating DeepSeek's technology across its platforms including WeChat, which has over 1 billion monthly active users.

财报显示，腾讯第二季度实现营业收入1845亿元人民币，高于市场平均预估的1790亿元。期内净利润达556亿元，同样超过市场预期的508亿元。

财报发布前，腾讯控股收涨4.74%，报586港元/股，创2021年6月以来新高。今年以来，腾讯控股累计涨幅约为40%。

彭博社分析指出，公司第二季度营收表现强劲，超出市场预期，为其在人工智能（AI）领域的雄心提供了有力支撑。

腾讯在财报中强调了其对人工智能领域的持续投入正在加速。公司表示，正加大在AI基础研究、模型迭代和产品化方面的投入力度。其庞大的游戏业务版图和拥有逾10亿用户的超级应用微信，被视为支撑这一战略的关键资金来源和落地场景。

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and other agencies also held meetings with Baidu (0700.HK), opens new tab and smaller Chinese tech firms in recent weeks, said one of the two people and a third source.

The Chinese officials asked companies why they needed to buy Nvidia chips when they could purchase from domestic suppliers, the sources.

Authorities also expressed concerns that materials Nvidia has asked companies to submit for U.S. government review could contain sensitive information including client data, one of the sources said.

However, the people, who declined to be identified because the meetings were not public, said the companies have not been ordered to stop buying H20 chips.

Nvidia said on Tuesday the H20 chip was ""not a military product or for government infrastructure"".

""China has ample supply of domestic chips to meet its needs. It won't and never has relied on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China,"" the statement said.

Baidu, ByteDance, Tencent and the CAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Earlier on Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that Chinese authorities have urged domestic companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips, particularly for government-related purposes.

Several companies were issued official notices discouraging the use of the H20, a less-advanced chip, mainly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

In a separate report, The Information reported that ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent had been ordered by the CAC in the past two weeks to suspend Nvidia chip purchases altogether, citing data security concerns.

The CAC directive was communicated at a meeting the regulator held with over a dozen Chinese tech firms, shortly after the Trump administration reversed the export curbs on H20 chips, according to the Information report.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment. Top contract chipmaker SMIC (0981.HK), opens new tab rose 5% on Tuesday on expectations of rising demand for locally-produced chips.

But even without an outright ban, the concerns expressed by Chinese authorities could threaten Nvidia's recently restored access to the Chinese market as Chinese companies look to keep in step with regulators.

Nvidia designed the H20 specifically for China after U.S. export restrictions on its more advanced AI chips took effect in late 2023. The H20 had since been the most sophisticated AI chip Nvidia was allowed to sell in China.

Earlier this year, U.S. authorities effectively banned its sale to China, but reversed the decision in July following an agreement between Nvidia and the Trump administration.

Last month, China's cyberspace regulator summoned Nvidia representatives, asking the company to explain whether the H20 posed backdoor security risks that could affect Chinese user data and privacy.

State-controlled media have intensified criticism of Nvidia in recent days. Yuyuan Tantian, affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, published an article on WeChat over the weekend claiming H20 chips pose security risks and lack technological advancement and environmental friendliness.

The scrutiny threatens a significant revenue stream for Nvidia, which generated $17 billion from China sales in its fiscal year ended January 26 - or 13% of total revenue.

China has accelerated work on domestic AI chip alternatives, with companies, such as Huawei (HWT.UL) developing processors that rival the H20's performance, and Beijing urging the technology sector to become more self-sufficient.

However, U.S. sanctions on advanced chipmaking equipment, including lithography machines essential for chip production, have constrained domestic manufacturers' ability to boost production.

On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China, despite deep-seated fears in Washington that Beijing could harness U.S. AI capabilities to supercharge its military.

China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it hoped the U.S. would act to maintain the stability and smooth operation of the global chip supply chain.

The Trump administration last week confirmed an unprecedented deal with Nvidia and AMD (AMD.O), opens new tab, which agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of revenue from sales of some advanced chips in China.

China's renewed guidance on avoiding chips also affects AI accelerators from AMD, Bloomberg also reported. It was not clear, however, whether any notices from Chinese authorities specifically mentioned AMD's MI308 chip.

AMD did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

[서울=뉴스핌] 배상희 기자 = 중국 대형 게임 개발사들의 해외 매출이 상반기에 이어 7월에도 전월 대비 큰 폭 증가한 것으로 나타났다.

글로벌 모바일 데이터 분석업체 센서타워(Sensor Tower)에 따르면 7월 한 달간 총 32곳의 중국 게임사가 글로벌 모바일 게임 퍼블리셔 매출 상위 100위권에 진입했으며, 총 매출액은 19억5000만 달러에 달했다. 이는 글로벌 상위 100위 모바일 게임 퍼블리셔 매출의 34%를 차지하는 수치다. 다만, 해당 데이터에는 중국 내 제3자 안드로이드 채널의 매출은 포함되지 않았다.

7월 한달 간 중국 주요 게임사와 대표 게임들의 매출도 전월 대비 크게 증가한 것으로 집계됐다.

대표적으로 텐센트(0700.HK)의 경우 양대 히트작이자 매출 견인의 핵심 주역 왕자영요(王者榮耀)와 화평정영(和平精英)을 비롯해 서바이벌 슈팅 게임인 PUBG Mobile(Player Unknown's Battle Grounds) 등의 주요 게임 매출이 7월에 크게 늘어나며 텐센트 게임의 글로벌 매출을 전월 대비 20% 증가시켰다. 이를 기반으로 텐센트는 중국 모바일 게임 퍼블리셔 글로벌 매출 순위에서 1위를 유지했다.

A주에 상장돼 있는 인터넷 게임 및 디지털 콘텐츠 제작사인 세기화통(世紀華通 002602.SZ)이 보유한 센추리게임즈(點點互動∙Century Games)의 해외 사업도 우수한 성과를 이어갔다.

센추리게임즈가 개발한 '킹샷(Kingshot)'과 '테이스티 트래블즈 : 머지 게임(Tasty Travels: Merge Game)'은 7월 매출이 각각 34%, 52% 증가했으며, 이에 따라 센추리게임즈의 전체 매출도 전월 대비 10% 추가 상승했다. 이를 바탕으로 센추리게임즈는 텐센트에 이어 순위 2위 자리를 지켰다.

이밖에 삼칠호오망락과기(三七互娛∙37 Interactive Entertainment 002555.SZ), 길비특(吉比特∙G-bits 603444.SH) 산하의 게임 운영 플랫폼 레이팅게임즈(雷霆遊戲), 거인네트워크(巨人網絡 002558.SZ) 등 다수의 A주 게임 상장사들이 상위권을 유지했다.

넷이즈(網易∙NetEase 9999.HK)와 미호요(米哈遊∙MiHoYo)는 3위와 4위를 차지했다.

넷이즈는 '에기파티(蛋仔派對∙Eggy Party)'의 인기가 회복되며 7월 글로벌 매출이 전달 대비 23% 급증했다. 미호요의 인기작 '붕괴:스타레일(崩壞:星穹鐵道∙Honkai：Star Rail)'은 2025년 들어 월 최고 매출을 기록하며 기업의 7월 전체 매출을 전달 대비 28% 늘리는데 결정적 역할을 했다.

주식시장에서도 해외 매출의 성장 이슈는 주가에 뚜렷한 촉매제 역할을 하고 있다.

대표적으로 해외 시장에서 높은 수익을 거두고 있는 세기화통과 거인네트워크는 올해 들어 각각 약 167%, 133% 상승하여 A주 게임사 중 가장 큰 폭의 주가 상승률을 기록했다.

지난해부터 중국 게임의 해외 시장 진출은 점차 침체기를 벗어나 활기를 띄고 있다.

최근 공개된 '2025년 1~6월 중국 게임 산업 보고서'에 따르면, 올해 상반기 중국 자체 개발 게임이 해외 시장에서 거둔 실제 매출은 95억100만 달러로, 전년 동기 대비 11.07% 증가했다.

2025-08-802654229,https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/chinas-nvidia-pushback-is-only-just-beginning-2025-08-12/,China's Nvidia pushback is only just beginning,"HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's relationship with Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab just got messier. Just one month after boss Jensen Huang's rockstar welcome in the People's Republic, state media has blasted the $4.4 trillion chipmaker's popular H20 processors over security concerns. Washington's latest plan to pocket 15% of Nvidia and AMD's (AMD.O), opens new tab high-end China sales will rankle Beijing even more. That puts customers like Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab in an awkward spot.

Nvidia's lucrative ties with the world's biggest importer of semiconductors have been upended by the trade war, geopolitics and the broader U.S-China rivalry in artificial intelligence. In April, U.S. President Donald Trump effectively banned the company from selling its China-specific H20 AI processor. That decision, which Huang said, opens new tab at the time would result in a $5.5 billion inventory writedown and $15 billion of lost revenue, was soon reversed as part of U.S. concessions to Beijing in exchange for continued supplies of rare earths.

That's a huge relief to Nvidia. Sales in China are forecast to surge 185% to roughly $49 billion in the fiscal year to January, per Visible Alpha, and account for nearly a quarter of total revenue. Even that may be conservative: Trump on Monday said he was open to Nvidia selling a scaled-back version of its most advanced Blackwell chip to China.

But the outlook is darkening once again. Washington's July ""AI Action Plan"" called, opens new tab for, among other things, stricter enforcement of export controls including ""new and existing location verification features"". That prompted China's cyberspace watchdog to summon Nvidia to a meeting. Last week, the U.S. company published, opens new tab a blog post in both English and Chinese reiterating that its chips did not have so-called backdoors, kill switches and spyware.

Those assurances have not been enough. A couple of weeks ago the state-owned People's Daily published an opinion piece titled, ""Nvidia, how can I trust you?""; that was followed on Sunday by another commentary elsewhere which criticised the H20 as a threat to security, technologically not that advanced and environmentally unfriendly. Worryingly, it concluded that China ""certainly had the option not to buy it"".

It's likely the intended audience is the country's technology giants. Those include Tencent and TikTok-parent ByteDance, which are in the process of submitting applications for H20 chips, Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter. But Beijing is keen to wean the country off foreign technology and have them buy domestic offerings instead. Moreover, Trump's latest 15% revenue collection deal will result in national champions indirectly handing money to the U.S. government; that will not sit well with President Xi Jinping.

The problem is, domestic AI chips from Huawei, Cambricon Technologies (688256.SS), opens new tab and others still have a long way to catch up to Nvidia's. And Huang has another formidable edge: its programming platform, CUDA, hosts many apps, frameworks and AI software that have become the industry's standard, making it hard and costly for customers to leave. Chinese unease toward Nvidia will only rise, but the country does not have much choice for now.

The gaming company raised money via share placements three times in the last year as it bets on its self-developed 'Strinova' to lead it back into the black

Key Takeaways: iDreamSky has conducted three share placements within a little more than a year, as it banks on its self-developed ""Strinova"" to lead it back to profitability The company expects to report a net profit of between 20 million yuan and 50 million yuan for the first half of 2025, representing its first profit in three years

In China's ultra-competitive online gaming world, iDreamSky Technology Holdings Ltd. (1119.HK) made a big contrarian bet that appears to be bearing fruit. As most game companies limited their development budgets, iDreamSky doubled down on such efforts, resolved to end its years of losses.

It has funded the gambit partly through a series of new share placements, mostly recently paying a $5 million licensing fee last week by issuing 38.1 million new shares priced at HK$1.024 each to Irish game publisher PLR Worldwide. The subscription price represented a discount of about 3.4% to the previous closing price, and the placement accounted for about 2.11% of iDreamSky's enlarged share capital, according to its announcement on the deal.

This sale was iDreamSky's third such share placement in about a year, following similar sales in May this year and July 2024. Those previous two placements raised HK$257 million ($33 million) and HK$70 million, respectively, to fund R&D and promotion for its games, including ""Strinova,"" the self-developed title on which the company is pinning its future.

The latest share issue was used to settle licensing fees and make the Irish game publisher a strategic iDreamSky's shareholder, signaling the potential for longer-term cooperation. iDreamSky also pointed out that such an approach would preserve its cash flow for other purposes and strengthen its financial position.

Casual game origins

iDreamSky wasn't historically known for its self-developed high-tech games. Instead, it rose to prominence as a Chinese publisher of high-quality games licensed from overseas developers, including hits like ""Gardenscapes,"" ""Subway Surfers"" and ""Temple Run."" Such a strategy worked well when China's gaming sector was booming and many companies used a similar licensing model. But as competition for premium games intensified, including a rise in games developed just for the China market, the revenue-sharing model became less sustainable. The company realized that greater control over its products was key to its longer-term survival.

That realization, despite consecutive years of losses and financial strain, led iDreamSky to place a big bet on its own game development, with ""Strinova"" as one of its first original self-developed titles.

The game combines anime-inspired art styles with mid- to hardcore shooting gameplay. The PC version launched in June 2023 generated strong downloads initially and livestream buzz. But it quickly experienced a drop-off, leading the company to admit to missteps in its overseas marketing strategy. Nonetheless, the game demonstrated iDreamSky's intent to move into self-developed games using AI-generated content, shooting experience modules and character interaction systems.

Key to transformation

While the PC version of Strinova fell short of expectations, iDreamSky remains committed to its new direction. Unlike miHoYo's ""Honkai: Star Rail"" and Tencent's ""Honor of Kings"" and ""CrossFire,"" which achieved huge success among hardcore gamers, iDreamSky started with casual games and never established a distinct brand identity or flagship product. ""Strinova"" marks a key shift to that strategy, and a key step in the company's transformation.

The mobile version of ""Strinova"" is expected to launch later this year, targeting the mainstream domestic mobile game market. iDreamSky said it has learned lessons from the PC launch, and will compensate for shortcomings of that experience. The company has said in its previous financial results that the game will be its core R&D focus for the next several quarters, with increased investment in marketing, community building, technology and content updates. It will also use AI to shorten development cycles and reduce labor costs.

iDreamSky has struggled financially over the last two years, reporting losses of 556 million yuan ($77 million) and 528 million yuan in 2023 and 2024, respectively, as its revenue shrank from 1.92 billion yuan to 1.51 billion yuan over that time. While its cash increased slightly by 3.4% year-on-year to about 196 million yuan by the end of 2024, the company's total borrowings rose to a much higher 1.07 billion yuan, highlighting the financial pressure it faces.

While the latest share issue didn't bring in any new funds, it reflected the company's strategic choice to conserve its financial resources by paying some of its development costs using shares rather than cash.

Notably, the company's ""Strinova"" gambit appears to be bearing fruit. Last month iDreamSky said it expects to report a net profit of 20 million yuan to 50 million yuan in the first half of the year, reversing three years of losses, including a 109 million yuan loss in the first half of 2024. Equally important, the company said its operating cash flow was positive for the latest six-month period, ranging from 30 million to 60 million yuan. Such results represent an important turnaround, and should boost investor confidence.

Despite its nascent return to profitability, iDreamSky's shares have fallen 56.5% year-to-date, and now hover around the HK$1 level. They got a notable 7.55% lift, rising to HK$1.14, after the latest placement announcement, suggesting investors like the company's strategy. iDreamSky trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 1, higher than the 0.75 times of CMGE Technology(0302.HK) and 0.85 times of IGG (0799.HK), but lower than the 4.5 times for XD Inc. (2400.HK), placing the company in the middle of the gaming pack.

Of course, a single product does not a turnaround make, especially as ""Strinova"" faces stiff competition from larger players like Tencent (0700.HK), NetEase (NTES.US; 9999.HK), and miHoYo, which are far more experienced at self-developed titles. Whether iDreamSky can compete with the big guns, or whether it may be just a one-hit wonder, remains to be seen. Accordingly, all eyes will be watching to see what's next for this company after ""Strinova"" runs its course.

8802584266,http://www.aastocks.com/tc/stocks/news/comment.aspx?id=38557,騰訊音樂估值較海外同業吸引,"分析員 : 黃德几 (研究部執行董事, 金利豐證券有限公司) 內地在線音樂平台騰訊音樂娛樂（1698.HK；NYSE：TME）將於8月12日公布2025年第二季度業績，6月宣布擬收購長音頻平台喜馬拉雅，正式進軍聲音經濟的新領域。隨着音樂娛樂生態逐步由娛樂導向轉向內容驅動，騰訊音樂的策略轉型或可為公司重啟增長動力。

騰訊音樂原為騰訊控股（0700.HK）旗下業務，由QQ音樂、酷狗音樂及酷我音樂合併而成，發展至今已是中國市佔率最高在線音樂平台，並形成「音樂內容＋社交娛樂」的雙引擎模式。收入主要分為兩大類，分別是線上音樂服務，包括音樂訂閱、數位專輯與廣告，及社交娛樂服務，即直播與虛擬禮物等互動場景。

值得留意的是，騰訊音樂近年逐漸由以往依賴社交娛樂收入的模式轉型至以音樂內容為主，原因在於一方面受監管環境及平台內容規範趨嚴，直播業務增長放緩；另一方面則是訂閱用戶規模不斷擴大，顯示用戶對高品質音樂內容的付費意願逐步提升。

集團今年第一季收入為73.6億元人民幣，按年增長8.7%，主要受惠在線音樂服務收入增長，部分被社交娛樂服務和其他服務收入下降所抵銷，在線音樂訂閱收入，按年增長16.6%至42.2億元人民幣，在線音樂付費用戶數同比增長8.3%至1.229億，按月淨增190萬。單個付費用戶月均收入從2024年同期的10.6元人民幣增長至11.4元人民幣，淨利潤為42.9億元人民幣，按年增長201.8%，截至今年3月31日，現金、現金等價物、定期存款和短期投資的合計餘額為人民幣

376.7億元。

今年6月，公司公布擬以12.6億美元現金，加上發行最多約5.57%新股，收購中國最大長音頻平台之一的喜馬拉雅，完成交易後將成為騰訊音樂的全資附屬公司，收購有助騰訊音樂從音樂平台延伸至聲音內容平台。與純音樂內容相比，長音頻節目包括有聲書、知識付費、相聲脫口秀及播客等形式，擁有更長的用戶停留時間與更高的黏性，有助提升整體用戶活躍度與內容消耗深度。

其次，喜馬拉雅擁有龐大的內容生產者生態與原創IP，未來可與騰訊音樂既有的音樂庫與藝人資源交叉整合，開展IP孵化與跨平台營銷，甚至結合短視頻或AI虛擬主播等新形式，增加內容商業化可能性。喜馬拉雅本身具備穩定的訂閱收入與知識付費模式，未來有望與TME訂閱業務相互促進，提升整體變現能力與用戶轉化率。

估值方面，相比歐美音樂平台如Spotify或SiriusXM等同業為低，隨着訂閱業務持續增長，以及長音頻內容收購後對整體收入的拉動效益陸續體現，公司估值有望重新獲得市場重估。

技術走勢上，五月中呈現突破性上升裂口，及後以一浪高於一浪形態上升，7月18日升至88.5元高位呈「黃昏之星」回落，形成小雙頂，跌至80元水平反彈，MACD熊差距略為收窄，重上10天及20天移動線，未持有可後低於80元水平吸納，中線目標價95元 ，不跌穿50天線76.85元可以繼續持有。

Anunțurile au fost făcute cu ocazia încheierii celei de-a treia ediții a Conferinței Mondiale de Inteligență Artificială, care s-a desfășurat la Shanghai și care s-a încheiat luni, relatează Reuters.
Conferința a fost și ocazia pentru lansarea unei serii de produse noi, precum un sistem de calcul bazat pe inteligență artificială de la Huawei (HWT.UL), considerat de experți drept un concurent serios al celor mai avansate oferte Nvidia. De asemenea, au fost prezentate produse prietenoase pentru consumatori, precum o gamă diversificată de ochelari digitali AI.
Una dintre alianțele anunțate, ""Model-Chip Ecosystem Innovation Alliance"", adună dezvoltatori chinezi de modele lingvistice mari (LLM) și producători de cipuri AI.
""Este un ecosistem inovativ care conectează întreaga tehnologie, de la cipuri la modele și infrastructură"", a declarat Zhao Lidong, CEO al Enflame, unul dintre producătorii de cipuri participanți. Alți membri ai alianței care produc unități de procesare grafică (GPU) includ Huawei, Biren și Moore Threads, companii afectate de sancțiunile impuse de SUA, care le blochează accesul la tehnologii avansate realizate cu know-how american. Alianța a fost anunțată de StepFun, un dezvoltator de modele lingvistice mari.
A doua alianță, Comitetul pentru Inteligență Artificială al Camerei de Comerț Generale din Shanghai, are ca scop ""promovarea integrării profunde a tehnologiei AI cu transformarea industrială"". Printre participanți se numără SenseTime (0020.HK), sancționată de SUA, care a pivotat de la tehnologia de recunoaștere facială către modelele lingvistice mari. Alte companii participante sunt StepFun și un alt dezvoltator de LLM, MiniMax, precum și producători de cipuri, Metax și Iluvatar CoreX.
Unul dintre cele mai discutate produse la conferință a fost CloudMatrix 384 de la Huawei, care integrează 384 de cipuri 910C și depășește performanțele modelului Nvidia GB200 NVL72 pe anumite criterii, conform firmei de cercetare SemiAnalysis din SUA. Capabilitățile de design ale Huawei au permis utilizarea unui număr mai mare de cipuri și inovații la nivel de sistem pentru a compensa performanțele mai scăzute ale fiecărui cip individual, a adăugat SemiAnalysis.
Cel puțin alte șase firme chineze de calcul au prezentat tehnologii similare de ""clustering"" a cipurilor. Metax a demonstrat un supernod AI care include 128 de cipuri C550, concepute pentru a susține cerințele mari de centre de date cu răcire pe bază de lichid.
Alte evenimente notabile au inclus prezentarea de către Tencent (0700.HK) a modelului său open-source Hunyuan3D World Model 1.0, care permite utilizatorilor să genereze medii interactive 3D prin comenzi text sau imagini. Baidu (9888.HK) a anunțat tehnologia sa de ""om digital"" de generație următoare, care ajută afacerile să creeze livestreameri virtuali. Aceasta include ""tehnologia de clonare"" care poate replica vocea, tonul și limbajul corporal al unei persoane din doar 10 minute de filmare.
În final, Alibaba (9988.HK) a anunțat lansarea ochelarilor AI Quark, alimentați de modelul AI Qwen, care urmează să fie disponibil pe piața din China până la sfârșitul anului 2025. Aceștia vor permite utilizatorilor să acceseze serviciile de hartă ale gigantului chinez și să utilizeze Alipay prin scanarea codurilor QR cu comenzi vocale.

2025-07-789820331,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-orders-300000-h20-chips-tsmc-due-robust-china-demand-sources-say-2025-07-29/,"Exclusive: Nvidia orders 300,000 H20 chips from TSMC due to robust China demand, sources say","BEIJING/SHANGHAI/NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab placed orders for 300,000 H20 chipsets with contract manufacturer TSMC (2330.TW), opens new tab last week, two sources said, with one of them adding that strong Chinese demand had led the U.S. firm to change its mind about just relying on its existing stockpile.

The Trump administration this month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China, reversing an effective ban imposed in April designed to keep advanced AI chips out of Chinese hands due to national security concerns.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for the Chinese market after U.S. export restrictions on its other AI chipsets were imposed in late 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its new Blackwell series sold in markets outside China.

The new orders with Taiwan's TMSC would add to existing inventory of 600,000 to 700,000 H20 chips, according to the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

For comparison purposes, Nvidia sold around 1 million H20 chips in 2024, according to U.S. research firm SemiAnalysis.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a trip to Beijing this month that the level of H20 orders it received would determine whether production would begin again, adding that any restart to the supply chain would take nine months.

The Information reported after Huang's trip that Nvidia had told customers it had limited H20 stocks available and it had no immediate plans to restart wafer production for the GPU.

Nvidia needs to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government to ship the H20 chips. It said in mid-July it had been assured by authorities that it would get them soon.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has yet to approve those licenses, one of the sources and a third source said.

Nvidia on Monday declined to comment on the new orders or the status of its license applications. TSMC declined to comment. The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nvidia has asked Chinese companies interested in purchasing Nvidia H20 chips to submit new documentation including order volume forecasts from clients, said one of the sources and a fourth source.

KEY PRODUCT IN US-SINO TRADE WAR

The Trump administration said the resumption of H20 sales was part of negotiations with China over rare earth magnets - elements essential for many industries and which Beijing had limited exports of as trade war tensions escalated.

The decision drew bipartisan condemnation from U.S. legislators who are worried that giving China access to the H20 will impede U.S. efforts to maintain its lead in AI technology.

But Nvidia and others argue that it is important to retain Chinese interest in its chips - which work with Nvidia's software tools - so that developers do not completely switch over to offerings from rivals like Huawei.

Before the April ban, Chinese technology giants including Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab, ByteDance and Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab substantially increased H20 orders as they deployed DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models as well as their own models.

The popularity of Nvidia products in China, despite the advent of rival, albeit less powerful, offerings from Huawei, has been underscored by a boom in repair demand for its other banned GPUS - many of which have been smuggled into the country.

After the April ban on H20 sales, Nvidia warned that it would have to write off $5.5 billion in inventories, while Huang told the Stratechery podcast that the company also had to forgo $15 billion in potential sales.

Sony said in a lawsuit filed on Friday that Tencent's upcoming ""Light of Motiram"" is a ""slavish clone"" of its games that copies several distinctive ""Horizon"" elements and threatens to confuse buyers.

Spokespeople for Tencent and attorneys and spokespeople for Sony did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.

Sony released the first game in the ""Horizon"" series, ""Horizon: Zero Dawn,"" on its PlayStation 4 in 2017. The games follow a red-headed woman named Aloy as she navigates a post-apocalyptic world populated by human tribes and robotic animals.

Sony said in its complaint that it declined an offer from Tencent to collaborate on a new ""Horizon"" game last year. Tencent later announced ""Light of Motiram,"" which Sony said features identical gameplay, story themes and artistic elements to ""Horizon"" as well as many other similarities.

Sony said that video game journalists have characterized ""Light of Motiram"" as a ""knock-off"" of ""Horizon,"" including one who called the game ""Horizon Zero Originality.""

Sony asked the court for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and an order blocking Tencent from violating its intellectual property rights.

The case is Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC v. Tencent Holdings Ltd, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:25-cv-06275.

The announcements were timed to coincide with the three-day World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai ending on Monday.

The conference also showcased a slew of new products, such as an AI computing system from Huawei (HWT.UL) that experts believe rivals Nvidia's most advanced offering, as well as consumer-friendly products such as several kinds of digital AI glasses.

The ""Model-Chip Ecosystem Innovation Alliance"" brings together Chinese developers of large language models (LLMs) and AI chip manufacturers.

""This is an innovative ecosystem that connects the complete technology chain from chips to models to infrastructure,"" said Zhao Lidong, CEO of Enflame, one of the participating chipmakers.

Other manufacturers of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the alliance include Huawei, Biren, and Moore Threads, which have been hit by U.S. sanctions that block them from purchasing advanced tech made with U.S. know-how. The alliance was announced by StepFun, an LLM developer.

A second alliance, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce AI Committee, aims to ""promote the deep integration of AI technology and industrial transformation.""

Participants include SenseTime (0020.HK), opens new tab, also sanctioned by the U.S. and which has pivoted from facial recognition technology to LLMs. Others are StepFun and another LLM developer, MiniMax, as well as chipmakers Metax and Iluvatar CoreX.

Huawei's system design capabilities have meant that it has been able to use more chips and system-level innovations to compensate for weaker individual chip performance, SemiAnalysis said.

At least six other Chinese computing firms showcased similar ""clustering"" chip technology. Metax demonstrated an AI supernode featuring 128 C550 chips designed to support large-scale liquid-cooled data centre requirements.

Other events included Tencent's (0700.HK), opens new tab unveiling of its open-source Hunyuan3D World Model 1.0, which the company said enables users to generate interactive 3D environments through text or image prompts.

Baidu (9888.HK), opens new tab announced what it said was next-generation ""digital human"" technology that helps businesses to create virtual livestreamers. It features ""cloning technology"" that can replicate a human's voice, tone, and body language from just 10 minutes of sample footage.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang will address the opening of the conference, highlighting the sector's importance to the leaders of the world's second-largest economy. Beijing has made AI and self-sufficiency in other cutting-edge technologies a pillar of its national development plan, saying it aims to make China the global leader in AI by 2030.

These ambitions have set China on a collision course with the U.S. as the superpowers compete for technological dominance.

President Donald Trump's administration has imposed export restrictions on advanced technology to China, including AI chips and chipmaking equipment, citing concerns that it could enhance Beijing's military capabilities.

Still, China has continued making AI breakthroughs that have drawn close scrutiny from U.S. officials.

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek unsettled the global AI industry this year with a low-cost model that rivals the performance of leading U.S. systems from companies like OpenAI - but was developed at a fraction of the cost.

Jensen Huang, CEO of AI chip titan Nvidia, described AI models from Chinese firms DeepSeek, Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab and Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab as ""world class"" during a visit to Beijing this month.

More than 800 companies are set to participate in this year's AI forum, showcasing over 3,000 high-tech products, 40 large language models, 50 AI-powered devices and 60 intelligent robots, organisers say.

In addition to the industry behemoths, the show will feature startups such as humanoid robot maker Unitree.

来源：市场资讯

来源：企业上市

阿里巴巴要开一年一度的股东大会了，时间是2025年9月25日晚上9点（北京时间），会议在网上开。

议案四：雇谁当审计师？

继续聘请普华永道（PwC）这家会计师事务所来审计公司2025财年的账目。因为公司在香港和美国都上市，所以需要两地不同的PwC分所来做。

审计费用（给会计师的钱）

2024财年：花了约1.65亿元

2025财年：花了约1.51亿元

这笔钱是付给普华永道（PwC）做审计的劳务费。比去年少了点，很正常。所有服务都经过了审计委员会的批准，流程合规。

1． 赚钱能力怎么样？（看收入与利润）

总收入（个头）：

2023财年：8686.87亿元

2024财年：9411.68亿元 （比去年涨了8%）

2025财年：9963.47亿元 （比去年涨了6%）

公司还在变大，收入每年都在增加，但增长速度放缓了（从8%降到6%），说明可能市场竞争激烈，或者业务进入成熟期。

净利润（最后真正赚到手里的钱）：

2023财年：655.73亿元

2024财年：713.32亿元 （比去年涨了9%）

2025财年：1259.76亿元 （比去年暴涨了77%！）

2． 审计费用（给会计师的钱）

2024财年：花了约1.65亿元

2025财年：花了约1.51亿元

这笔钱是付给普华永道（PwC）做审计的劳务费。比去年少了点，很正常。所有服务都经过了审计委员会的批准，流程合规。

阿里巴巴要开一年一度的股东大会了，时间是2025年9月25日晚上9点（北京时间），会议在网上开。这次大会要讨论几件重要的事，比如要不要授权公司发行新股、回购股票，以及选举几位董事。

主要事项和解读

1． 开会基本信息

什么时候开？ 2025年9月25日晚上9点（北京/香港时间）。

在哪开？ 网上开。普通股股东和持有美国存托股（ADS）的股东参加不同的线上会议。

谁可以参加/投票？

普通股股东： 在 2025年8月5日 收盘时还持有阿里巴巴香港股票（9988.HK）的人。

美国存托股（ADS）股东： 在2025年8月5日 收盘时还持有阿里巴巴美股（BABA）的人。（注意：1股美股BABA = 8股普通股）

2． 要讨论和投票的几件大事（议案）

议案一：能不能印新股票？

说人话： 请求股东批准，允许董事会可以在下次股东大会前，根据需要发行不超过当前总股本10%的新股票（用于融资、激励员工等）。

建议投票： 通常董事会都希望这个授权通过，这样公司运作更灵活。

议案二：能不能回购股票？

说人话： 请求股东批准，允许董事会可以在下次股东大会前，花钱从市场上买回不超过当前总股本10%的公司股票（回购股票通常能提振股价，回报股东）。

建议投票： 这对股东通常是好事，一般都会赞成。

议案三：选谁当董事？

说人话： 投票选举四位董事，让他们干到2028年的股东大会。这四个人是：

吴泳铭（现任CEO）

杨致远（雅虎创始人，老熟人）

Wan Ling MARTELLO（一位女性高管）

吴港平（安永前大佬，财务专家）

怎么选？ 对这四个人是分开投票的，一个一个选。

议案四：雇谁当审计师？

继续聘请普华永道（PwC）这家会计师事务所来审计公司2025财年的账目。因为公司在香港和美国都上市，所以需要两地不同的PwC分所来做。

建议投票： 这是常规操作，一般都会通过。

作为股东，你需要做什么？

这完全取决于你怎么持有阿里的股票：

情况一：你直接持有港股（9988.HK）

你会收到一份投票委托书。

你想去开会？ 大会当天可以登录网上平台（https：//meetings.computershare.com/Alibaba2025AGM） 观看直播、提问和投票。

你不想去开会？ 更常见的做法是：提前填好那份投票委托书，选择你对每个议案是赞成、反对还是弃权，然后在2025年9月23日晚上9点前寄回去（或按说明在线提交）。这样就算你投完票了。

情况二：你通过港股券商/银行持有股票

你是""间接持有""。券商会通知你（比如通过邮件或App推送）。

你需要按照你的券商的指引去投票，比如在App里点击操作。截止日期以券商的通知为准。

情况三：你持有美股（BABA）

你会收到存托银行（花旗银行）发来的美国存托股投票卡。

你无法在大会上直接投票！ 你必须填好这个投票卡，告诉花旗银行""请帮我按我的意愿投票""。

deadline非常非常重要！ 必须在纽约时间2025年9月16日上午10点前让你的投票指示到达花旗银行手里。

如果你不投会怎样？ 花旗银行会默认你对所有议案投赞成票。

你也可以 在大会当天登录一个专门的网站（https：//www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/alibaba25） 去听会、提问，但不能在那里投票。投票必须提前通过投票卡完成。

重要提醒（风险提示）

公告开头特意强调：阿里因为""合伙人制度""（阿里巴巴合伙有权提名多数董事），在香港上市规则里被看作是""同股不同权""的公司。

说人话： 公司的控制权并不完全由普通股股东按持股比例决定。创始团队和管理层通过这个制度保留了很大的决策权。投资这种公司，意味着你的投票权和对公司的影响力是有限的，这就是潜在风险。

总结一下你需要记住的：

记住日期： 开会是9月25日，但投票截止日更早（港股9月23日，美股9月16日）。

看清身份： 搞清楚自己持有的是港股还是美股，这决定了你怎么投票。

四大议题： 发新股、回购股票、选董事、聘审计。

务必投票： 你的投票对公司治理很重要。别偷懒，花几分钟操作一下。

如果还找不到投票入口，可以去阿里官网的""投资者关系""栏目找，或者直接联系你开户的券商。

One of the world's biggest hedge funds, Bridgewater sold its entire holdings in about 16 Chinese stocks and two China-focused exchange-traded funds with a total value close to $1.5 billion, Reuters calculated, based on a U.S. regulatory filing on Wednesday.

The filing, which is a quarterly mandatory requirement for investment managers to disclose U.S. equity holdings, does not include Bridgewater's holdings in Chinese stocks outside of the U.S, such as those listed in Hong Kong or mainland A-shares.

Bridgewater didn't immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Over the April to June period, Bridgewater's largest selling included 5.7 million shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab, , 2.8 million shares in online retailer JD.com and 2 million shares in search engine firm Baidu , the filing showed.

Meanwhile, it added more shares in major U.S. tech firms including Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab.

Founded by billionaire and longtime China bull Ray Dalio about 50 years ago, the Connecticut-based fund has been an active China investor for many years. Dalio sold his remaining stake in Bridgewater last month.

Bridgewater launched its China onshore fund in 2018 and has since rapidly grown its assets under management in China to about 50 billion yuan ($6.96 billion).

The fund's risk-off stance on China comes as U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on imports from China to over 100% in early April, which China reciprocated. The tit-for-tat moves sent shockwaves through global markets, leading to big corrections in both U.S. and China stocks in April.

Investor concerns over the possible forced de-listing of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges have also mounted.

Burry, known as the ""Big Short"" investor for his prescient calls ahead of the 2008 U.S. housing market crash, placed bets that benefit from a rise in share prices. The call options convey the right to buy shares at a set price in the future.

The investor bought call options on Chinese companies Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab and JD.com (9618.HK), opens new tab, Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML Holding (ASML.AS), opens new tab and on some U.S. names, such as cosmetics company Estee Lauder (EL.N), opens new tab, Lululemon Athletica (LULU.O), opens new tab, Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O), opens new tab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), opens new tab, and VF Corp (VFC.N), opens new tab.

Scion's portfolio also included long-only positions in Bruker Corp (BRKR.O), opens new tab, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Regeneron, and UnitedHealth.

Burry's second-quarter portfolio contrasts with bets against Alibaba, Baidu (9888.HK), opens new tab, JD.com and PDD Holdings (PDD.O), opens new tab in the first quarter, ahead of Trump's announcement of high levies on goods imported from China.

Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (9618.HK) beat market estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, signaling resilient consumer spending on its platform fueled by price cuts and government subsidies.

U.S.-listed shares of the company, the leading online platform for home appliance products and electronics in China, fell nearly 4% in morning trade in the U.S. on Thursday.

Consumer demand in China has remained muted amid persistent economic pressures and trade uncertainty, but retailers like JD.com have leaned on deep discounts, promotions and government stimulus to spur sales.

M Science analyst Vinci Zhang said JD beat forecasts, but the upside came mostly from electronics and appliances propped up by state subsidies.

With those subsidies launching in Q3 last year, ""JD will start to face tough year-on-year comparisons and that's when we will really get to evaluate how well the company is doing,"" Zhang said.

Facing sluggish consumption and fierce rivalry at home, JD.com is tapping new opportunities.

Last month it offered to buy electronics giant Ceconomy (CECG.DE) in a bid that values the German company at 2.2 billion euros ($2.57 billion), seen as a strategic step for JD.com to expand its footprint in Europe and strengthen its global presence in the retail industry.

In February it entered the food delivery business, a field that has been mainly dominated by Meituan (3690.HK) and Alibaba's (9988.HK) Ele.me, offering incentives to consumers to gain an edge.

CEO Sandy Xu told analysts on Thursday that the new food-delivery arm is already feeding traffic into JD's core retail engine but warned that ""excessive competition"" only undermines pricing and merchants, calling it unsustainable.

Total revenue rose 22.4% to 356.66 billion yuan ($49.73 billion) during the second quarter ended June, compared with analysts' average estimate of 331.63 billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.",eng,Profit by Pakistan Today,2025-08-14T18:48:16Z,2025-08-14,18:48:16
2025-08-805262633,https://www.reuters.com/technology/jdcom-faces-battle-gain-ground-chinas-instant-delivery-market-2025-08-14/,JD.com faces battle to gain ground in China's instant delivery market,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (9618.HK), opens new tab, is going all out to build its instant-delivery business to diversify revenue, but breaking into the competitive industry is proving difficult.

The company has poured billions into JD Takeaway, the food-delivery unit it launched in February, to cut reliance on a core retail business hit by a weak economy and tough competition.

Its results on Thursday showed the service has lifted its user base, traffic and revenue, with both quarterly active customer growth and shopping frequency up more than 40%.

But it is struggling to take market share from long-established incumbents Meituan (3690.HK), opens new tab, the industry leader, and Alibaba's (9988.HK), opens new tab Ele.me.

Daily active users in JD's delivery business have fallen steadily since peaking in mid-June, slipping more than 13% week-on-week by July 27 versus a 6% drop and a 1% gain in the previous two weeks, M Science data showed.

The data signals ""a significant loss of momentum for JD.com, and likely market share loss"", M Science analyst Vinci Zhang said.

""Meituan and Alibaba already have considerable domain expertise in food delivery, and I don't think JD has expertise in that area yet. It will be very challenging,"" Zhang said.

JD.com's food delivery investments have also squeezed profitability. Its adjusted operating margin shrank to 0.3% in the June quarter from 4% a year ago.

Meituan's daily orders across food and retail goods reached an all-time high of 120 million. The company holds nearly 70% of the delivery market, Morningstar analysts said in May.

Alibaba's Taobao instant commerce business combined with Ele.me reached 80 million daily orders early in July, with daily active users crossing 200 million.

Company executives have warned of fierce competition, with the three companies together pledging nearly 200 billion yuan ($27.87 billion) in recent months to subsidize instant delivery, sparking an ""instant retail"" price war that has drawn regulatory scrutiny.

""The competition started to intensify since July,"" JD.com CEO Sandy Xu said on Thursday, adding the company was focused on improving its platform to attract more users, merchants and riders.

Meituan and Alibaba are yet to report quarterly results.

2025-08-803489271,https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-fight-against-price-wars-is-an-uphill-battle-2025-08-12/,China's fight against price wars is an uphill battle,"HONG KONG, August 13 (Reuters) - Overcapacity has made its way into China's domestic market, with price wars leading to collapsing profitability and accelerating deflation. The government has responded by launching a so-called ""anti-involution"" program to combat deflationary price wars. It's had some early wins, but this could be a lengthy battle.

The Chinese internet slang for ""involution"" originally referred to competitive pressures faced by young Chinese in education and the workplace. Since early 2024, however, the word has come to describe supposedly excessive, unsustainable competition among Chinese firms, where more resources are being invested without increasing higher returns.

The Chinese government began to highlight the economic dangers of involution as early as June 2024, opens new tab in the face of declining corporate margins and profitability across diverse sectors such as electric vehicles, solar panels, lithium batteries, steel, cement and food delivery.

Critiques of ""excessive"" competition grew much louder in the first half of 2025 as several price wars escalated. In particular, EV leader BYD(002594.SZ), opens new tab started sharply cutting prices, and food delivery giant Meituan (3690.HK), opens new tab and new ecommerce platform JD.com(9618.HK), opens new tab began offering discounts and subsidies.

Increased competition in China also appears to be amplifying deflationary pressures. While China's Producer Price Index (PPI) has been in negative territory for much of the last three years, hopes of escaping this morass were ignited in mid-2024 as domestic demand appeared to be recovering. However, that optimism was doused this year as price wars intensified, with PPI falling by 3.6% year-on-year in the most recent report.

EARLY DAYS

China's government, recognising that industrial overcapacity is a potential danger to the domestic economy, launched a multi-pronged anti-involution campaign in July.

The program seeks to channel investment funds to advanced manufacturing, control production in highly competitive industries like steel, oversee pricing and subsidies in EVs and food delivery, and continue phasing out obsolete industrial capacity.

It's early days, but some nascent impacts are visible. Carmakers' average price discount declined in July, and Meituan, JD.com and Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab recently agreed to end aggressive discounting in food delivery and promote ""fair competition"".

Industry consolidation has accelerated as well. Polysilicon manufacturers are discussing the creation of a $7 billion fund to acquire and shut down almost one-third of their production capacity and restructure part of the loss-making sector.

Additionally, the country's largest coal miner, China Shenhua Energy (601088.SS), opens new tab , stated its intention to acquire various assets from the subsidiaries of its controlling shareholder to improve operational efficiency.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

China's anti-involution program faces myriad hurdles, however.

For one, most of the targets of the anti-involution program are in the private sector, which means they will be making voluntary pledges to maintain pricing discipline and thus could revert to aggressive tactics in the face of market pressure.

Importantly, Beijing's previous supply-side structural reforms from 2015-17 reduced excess capacity among state-owned firms, over which Beijing, by definition, had much more control.

Moreover, many of China's local governments are highly indebted and may prioritise short-term revenue generation over long-term reform, potentially offering subsidies to firms to attract investment even in industries targeted by the anti-involution campaign.

Innovation in emerging technologies could also be a casualty if deterring overlapping investments hinders experimentation with different approaches. And tighter oversight on pricing and capacity could dampen private capital's investment enthusiasm overall.

Finally, one of the biggest risks to the implementation of the program is the possibility of job losses as industries consolidate and become more inefficient.

While China's youth unemployment rate has declined recently, it remains high and could increase over the next few months as over 12 million new university graduates join the workforce. And the private sector - the target of the anti-involution program - generates the vast majority of China's incremental employment.

UPDATED PLAYBOOK

China's anti-involution efforts have had some success, but this will likely not be a short fight.

First, to truly absorb excess capacity in various industries, Beijing will almost certainly have to stimulate domestic consumption more aggressively than it has in the past. Sentiment among Chinese consumers remains quite low, implying that the monetary and fiscal stimuli undertaken by China's government over the past year have had only a limited impact.

The government could also consider more innovative, hitherto untested policies.

For example, it could mandate superior product quality to weed out players who compete purely on cost to encourage industry consolidation. However, defining ""low quality"" and enforcing standards would be challenging, and this strategy may be less effective in services industries.

Another way to reduce the incentives for extreme competition would be encouraging collaboration between firms through technology sharing and mutual equity holdings.

And the increased availability of patient long-term capital could obviate the need for companies to ramp up production and revenues rapidly.

The anti-involution program marks a new phase of China's pursuit of high-quality development. Enforcing pricing discipline and market stability in furiously competitive industries will be no easy task. That means an updated playbook may be needed.

Ovakav potez bi mogao da oteža napore kompanije da oživi opadajuću prodaju u Kini.

Zvanična obaveštenja poslata su brojnim firmama kako bi ih odvratila od korišćenja H20 čipa, koji je manje napredan, naročito za projekte državnih preduzeća ili privatnih kompanija povezane s vladom ili nacionalnom bezbednošću, navodi se u izveštaju, pozivajući se na izvore upoznate s tim.

Rojters nije mogao odmah da potvrdi ove navode.

Nvidia je u utorak izjavila da čip H20 ""nije vojni proizvod niti je namenjen za državnu infrastrukturu"".

""Kina ima dovoljno domaćih čipova da zadovolji svoje potrebe. Ne oslanja se i nikada se nije oslanjala na američke čipove za državne operacije, isto kao što se vlada SAD ne bi oslanjala na čipove iz Kine"", navedeno je u saopštenju.

Vašington je prošlog meseca ukinuo zabranu prodaje čipa H20 u Kini, a on je sada najnapredniji čip za veštačku inteligenciju koji Envidija sme da prodaje na tom tržištu.

Ovaj potez dolazi nakon izveštaja kineskih državnih medija o bezbednosnim zabrinutostima u vezi s H20 čipovima. Nvidia je saopštila da čipovi nemaju ""tajne prolaze"" koji bi omogućili daljinski pristup ili kontrolu.

Prema pisanju Fajnenšel tajmsa, Peking vrši pritisak na velike kineske tehnološke kompanije poput Alibabe (9988.HK) i BajtDensa da preispitaju porudžbine H20 čipova. Ministarstvo industrije i informacionih tehnologija od ovih kompanija traži objašnjenje zašto naručuju H20 čipove umesto da koriste domaće alternative, navodi list pozivajući se na izvore upoznate s materijom.

Neke tehnološke kompanije planiraju da smanje svoje porudžbine kao posledicu regulatornih pitanja, piše Fajnenšel tajms. Alibaba i BajtDens nisu odmah odgovorili na Rojtersov zahtev za komentar.

Kina takođe nastoji da promoviše korišćenje domaćih tehnologija, uključujući AI čipove koje proizvodi Huavej, kineski rival s kojim BajtDens vodi borbu za dominaciju u oblasti AI čipova.

Akcije najvećeg kineskog ugovornog proizvođača čipova SMIC-a porasle su u utorak za 5% zbog očekivanja povećane potražnje za domaće proizvedenim čipovima.

Ograničenje korišćenja H20 čipova dolazi i nakon izjava američkog predsednika Donalda Trampa u ponedeljak, u kojima je nagovestio da bi mogao dozvoliti Envidiji prodaju umanjene verzije svog naprednog Blekvel čipa u Kini, uprkos duboko ukorenjenim strahovima u Vašingtonu da bi Peking mogao iskoristiti američke AI kapacitete za jačanje vojne moći.

Kinesko ministarstvo spoljnih poslova saopštilo je u utorak da se nada da će SAD preduzeti praktične korake kako bi se održala stabilnost i nesmetano funkcionisanje globalnog lanca snabdevanja čipovima.

Prošle nedelje Trampova administracija je potvrdila presedan - dogovor s kompanijama Envidija i AMD prema kojem će vlada SAD dobiti 15% prihoda od prodaje određenih naprednih čipova u Kini.

Prema Blumbergovom izveštaju, kineske smernice o izbegavanju čipova odnose se i na AI akceleratore kompanije Advanced Micro Devices, a nije jasno da li su zvanična obaveštenja iz Kine posebno pominjala AMD-ov MI308 čip.

AMD nije odgovorio na zahtev za komentar van redovnog radnog vremena.",hrv,Ubrzanje Telegraf,2025-08-12T15:13:01Z,2025-08-12,15:13:01

鑒於市場的強勁勢頭和新進入者的持續湧入，Counterpoint已上調今年和明(2026)年的智慧眼鏡市場預測。Counterpoint預計，2024年至2029年期間，該市場將以逾60%的複合年增長率(CAGR)增長。這一顯著的擴張預計將惠及整個生態系統中的所有參與者，包括智慧眼鏡OEM、晶片供應商、ODM/EMS合作夥伴、音訊、電池和結構組件供應商，甚至包括傳統眼鏡銷售渠道。

Counterpoint高級研究分析師Flora Tang表示，今年上半年全球電子設備面臨的關稅危機，對智慧眼鏡市場的衝擊相對有限；依目前看，關鍵的原始設備製造商(OEM)及其製造合作夥伴仍能應對此局面。此外，儘管有其他新產品的推出，Meta在全球智慧眼鏡市場的份額在今年上半年仍攀升至73%，而除Meta外，上半年活躍在AI智慧眼鏡領域的關鍵OEM還包括中國的雷鳥科技(推出RayNeo V3系列)、小米(推出首款小米AI眼鏡)、雷神(推出AURA智慧眼鏡)等。

從下半年開始，Counterpoint預計，將有更多AI智慧眼鏡進入市場，包括來自互聯網巨頭Meta和阿里巴巴(9988.HK)的新品。Meta最近推出Oakley Meta眼鏡，與Ray-Ban Meta AI眼鏡相比，該產品具有更長的電池續航時間和更出色的影片拍攝質量，主要面向運動員和運動愛好者。行業調研顯示，市場對該型號的回饋較為積極。",zho,MoneyDJ理財網,2025-08-12T06:11:57Z,2025-08-12,06:11:57

2025-08-796560512,https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/jdcom-launch-five-discount-stores-competition-intensifies-2025-08-05/,JD.com to launch five discount stores as competition intensifies,"BEIJING, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Chinese retailer JD.com (9618.HK), opens new tab plans to open five discount superstores in two Chinese cities, marking its latest move into new segments as competition intensifies in its core e-commerce market.

Confirming a report in Beijing Business Today, a government-backed newspaper, the company told Reuters on Tuesday that the supermarkets will be in Zhuozhou city in Hebei province and Suqian, Jiangsu province.

The first outlet in Zhuozhou will span 5,000 square metres and will carry everything from detergent to chocolate, with prices intended to be below prevailing market levels.

JD first entered the market last year with the opening of two smaller discount stores in Beijing, aiming to tempt cautious shoppers to spend as China's consumption recovery stalls.

The 27-year-old e-commerce retailer launched ""instant delivery"" services for food and other goods earlier this year, kickstarting a subsidy war between itself and rival platforms such as Alibaba and Meituan.

It also announced that it would renew an international push for growth, launching its consumer-focused express delivery service abroad. It also bought Germany's Ceconomy (CECG.DE), opens new tab, Europe's largest consumer electronics retailer, for 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) last month.

Other rivals have been adjusting their bricks-and-mortar retail operations.

On Tuesday, local newspaper The Economic Observer reported that the final Freshippo X club store, the membership store which is part of Alibaba's (9988.HK), opens new tab grocery chain, will close its doors on August 31, ending an attempt to battle Costco and Sam's Club.

这场从7月持续至今的补贴狂欢曾带来全网狂欢，但也带来了行业压力和消费乱象。

饮品""秋一杯""即将到来，平台与商家又将面临什么样的全新考验？

刚刚过去的周末，外卖行业风向突变。美团、京东、饿了么、淘宝闪购等平台集体发布声明，宣布将抵制""0元购""等非理性促销行为，规范补贴机制，保障商家自主定价与合理利润。

这一外卖巨头平台的""联动叫停""，标志着自今夏以来轰轰烈烈的""外卖大战""暂告一段落。

消息发布当天，美团（3690.HK）、京东（9618.HK）、阿里巴巴（9988.HK）等港股平台股价全线上涨，美团盘中涨近3%，阿里涨超3%。

美团在其声明中强调，将严格遵守《反垄断法》《价格法》等法规，杜绝以显著低于成本价进行补贴，不强制或变相强制商家参与活动，并保障商家的定价权与知情权；

淘宝与饿了么则明确提出不再大规模推行""0元购""，将合理规划补贴、建立治理机制、设立兜底赔付；

京东同样表示将搭建简单透明的补贴机制，坚决抵制不正当竞争，维护中小商户利益。

三方不约而同地将规范促销行为、保护商家权益作为核心，这场外卖大战终于落下帷幕。

回顾整个7月，外卖平台的补贴战一度""卷""到了极致。

客观来看，这场流量狂欢，确实在短期内极大激发了大众对茶饮、咖啡的消费热情，也在社交平台上掀起一波又一波""超低价喝奶茶""的热潮。

但高强度补贴的背后，商家的真实境遇不容忽视。

咖门采访中，一些商家表示：高峰时段部分品牌订单量增长20%，但平均到手利润却跌破35%，更有商家表示""做一单反赔2~3元""。（传送门：""一天卖光半年库存""，外卖再次大爆单，茶饮店真赚吗？）

部分平台甚至在未充分沟通的情况下自动开启补贴，令商家陷入""亏本也得干""的被动局面。

不仅如此，极限出品下的服务崩溃也频频上演 -- -- 订单频频出错、骑手配送延迟、顾客退单增加，大量无人认领的奶茶堆积在门店外，损耗率激增，品牌口碑也面临不小挑战。

某些从业者更担心：一旦回归原价，顾客是否还能""买账""，或将成为平台和品牌面前的一道新难题。

随着立秋临近，茶饮行业即将迎来又一关键营销节点。""秋天的第一杯奶茶""一直是近些年来各平台集中发力、拉动销量的重要时机。

在今年""浩浩荡荡""的补贴高潮之后，集体叫停信号的突然到来，也给后续走势带来了一些不确定性。

热度之后留下的，是消费者价格预期被""拉低""的现实问题。

一些业内人士担忧，若奶茶恢复原价，消费者是否还能接受？而没有大额补贴托底的""秋一杯""，还能制造出怎样的话题与流量？

对饮品行业来说，接下来的考验将回归""内容力""与""品牌力""本身：如何在没有价格战的背景下，通过产品创新、门店体验、个性化营销等手段重新拉回消费者的注意力。

平台也将逐步从比补贴转向比服务、比品质，建立更可持续的外卖生态。

对于即将到来的""秋一杯""，比起一夜爆单的喧哗，也许值得期待的，是品牌和平台们更克制、更聪明的营销玩法，是行业重回良性竞争与理性增长的轨道。",zho,21jingji.com,2025-08-05T00:24:45Z,2025-08-05,00:24:45

Η γερμανική εταιρεία λιανικής ηλεκτρονικών ειδών Ceconomy (CECG.DE) επιβεβαίωσε την Πέμπτη ότι βρίσκεται σε προχωρημένες διαπραγματεύσεις για πιθανή εξαγορά της από την κινεζική JD.com (9618.HK), με προσφορά 4,60 ευρώ ανά μετοχή.

Προηγουμένως, το Bloomberg είχε αναφέρει ότι η JD.com πλησιάζει σε απόφαση για την υποβολή πρότασης εξαγοράς της Ceconomy. Η εταιρεία, που είναι ιδιοκτήτρια των αλυσίδων MediaMarkt και Saturn, επιβεβαίωσε τις προχωρημένες συνομιλίες, τονίζοντας όμως ότι δεν έχουν υπογραφεί νομικά δεσμευτικές συμφωνίες και δεν είναι ακόμη βέβαιο αν θα προχωρήσει η εξαγορά.

Οι βασικοί μέτοχοι της Ceconomy, δηλαδή η οικογένεια Κέλερχαλς και η οικογενειακή εταιρεία χαρτοφυλακίου Haniel από το Ντούισμπουργκ, δεν έκαναν άμεσα κάποιο σχόλιο. Το ίδιο έκαναν και οι μικρότεροι μέτοχοι Meridian, Beisheim και Freenet (FNTGn.DE).

Η οικογένεια Κέλερχαλς, ιδρυτές των MediaMarkt και Saturn, κατέχει σχεδόν το 30% των μετοχών της Ceconomy μέσω του επενδυτικού οχήματος Convergenta, αποτελώντας τον μεγαλύτερο μεμονωμένο μέτοχο. Η Haniel διατηρεί περίπου 17%, ενώ το 36,3% των μετοχών της Ceconomy βρίσκεται σε ελεύθερη διασπορά.

Οι επωνυμίες MediaMarkt και Saturn προσφέρουν στην JD.com πρόσβαση σε ένα από τα μεγαλύτερα διαδικτυακά καταστήματα ηλεκτρονικών ειδών στην Ευρώπη, καθώς και σε δίκτυο περίπου 1.000 φυσικών καταστημάτων σε πολλές ευρωπαϊκές χώρες, όπου απασχολούνται περίπου 50.000 εργαζόμενοι.

Η Ceconomy κατέγραψε ετήσιες πωλήσεις 22,4 δισ. ευρώ για τη χρήση 2023/24, εκ των οποίων 5,1 δισ. ευρώ προήλθαν από τα ηλεκτρονικά της καταστήματα.

Η JD.com, που ανταγωνίζεται την Alibaba (9988.HK) και την Amazon (AMZN.O), είχε εξετάσει το ενδεχόμενο εξαγοράς της βρετανικής αλυσίδας ηλεκτρονικών Currys πέρυσι, αλλά οι συζητήσεις δεν καρποφόρησαν. Το κύριο ενδιαφέρον της JD.com επικεντρωνόταν στο δίκτυο καταστημάτων και αποθηκών της Currys για την περαιτέρω ανάπτυξή της στην Ευρώπη, κάτι που προσφέρει και η Ceconomy με αντίστοιχη παρουσία στην ευρωπαϊκή ήπειρο.",ell,Reporter.gr,2025-08-02T14:44:44Z,2025-08-02,14:44:44

2025-08-793049157,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/chinas-weak-job-market-stirs-boom-era-nostalgia-social-media-2025-08-01/,China's weak job market stirs boom-era nostalgia on social media,"HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Dwindling job and income prospects in China are fuelling intense social media chatter about the fashion and culture of the country's high-growth period 20 years ago, in what analysts describe as a way to express discontent about the economy without attracting censorship.

The hashtag phrase ""beauty in the time of economic upswings,"" often accompanied by early 2000s pictures of celebrities wearing bright clothes and make-up or music videos and TV ads from that period, surged in social media mentions over the summer just as 12.2 million university students graduated.

They entered one of the most challenging job markets in decades - pandemic years aside - as the world's second-largest economy grapples with higher U.S. trade tariffs, deflation, industrial overcapacity and sluggish domestic consumption.

While China is growing at roughly 5% this year, analysts describe it as a dual-speed economy, with manufacturing and exports running strong, while households struggle. The current pace is half of that from the 2001-2010 decade.

""The economy has its cycles, but youth doesn't come twice,"" a social media user wrote on a widely-shared post on the topic.

The State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the government, did not respond to a comment request.

China's ruling Communist Party exerts a high degree of control over domestic media and social media in the name of safeguarding social stability and preventing the spread of rumours and fake news.

Reports and public discussions on what the Party considers as sensitive are routinely removed from the internet, including views critical of the economy and any veiled criticism of policymakers.

On RedNote, China's version of Instagram, the hashtag has so far garnered close to 50 million views.

Most posts come from millennial women recalling greater career and consumption choices in their twenties, says Yaling Jiang, founder of consultancy ApertureChina, citing platform data.

But it is today's young Chinese, who face far more limited options, engaging with these posts.

""Considering when it has gone viral, this is likely a response to the widespread complaints about the declining value of higher education and the increasingly tough job market for young graduates this summer,"" Jiang said.

Xiao Qiang, the founder of U.S.-based China Digital Times, which tracks China censorship, says the topic's popularity ""poses a challenge to the authorities mainly because it uses everyday symbols, such as make-up and fashion, to subtly express dissatisfaction with economic decline and life pressure.""

""It creates a collective atmosphere of nostalgia and indirect criticism,"" Xiao said. ""It can quietly erode public confidence in the official economic narrative.""

The content is ""awkward"" for censors, says Xiao, as most users share opinions over the aesthetics of China's recent past and express positive emotions.

MARKETING OPPORTUNITY

Fashion labels such as Giorgio Armani, Estee Lauder's Tom Ford (EL.N), opens new tab and Valentino (PRTP.PA), opens new tab have sponsored ""boom era""-themed posts on RedNote in the past 30 days, said Jiang.

More than a dozen stores on Alibaba's (9988.HK), opens new tab Taobao e-commerce platform have used this tag to sell clothes.

Bloggers have promoted the ""Millennial Rose"" shampoo by Procter & Gamble's (PG.N), opens new tab Safeguard, or bulky Nike (NKE.N), opens new tab sneakers advertised on Taobao as ""millennial classics reborn.""

L'Oreal-owned Maybelline (OREP.PA), opens new tab, in a Weibo post promoting some of its brighter lipsticks, wrote ""feel the beauty and vitality of the economic upswing.""

However, early-millennium looks are not prominent on Chinese streets. Jiang said marketing teams are leveraging the social media trend for brand awareness, not pushing new 2000s-inspired collections.

Fashion bloggers posting under the ""upswing"" hashtag say styles often reflect the prevailing economic mood.

This year's make-up trends, for instance, feature the more conservative, less expressive ""glass skin,"" achieved through heavy use of moisturisers and hydrating primers or monochromatic looks where foundation, blushes or lipsticks can differ in gradient but belong to the same colour palette.

The 2000s embraced futurism with metallic tones, glossy finishes and pearlescent blue or green eyeshadows. Full-eyeliner looks with smoky eyes contrasted with Barbie-pink lips for dramatic effect.

""In times of economic growth, make-up is meant to look expensive and give out that glow of confidence that comes with flying careers and optimism,"" one beauty blogger wrote.

Ceconomy's MediaMarkt and Saturn brands will give JD.com, which competes with Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab and Amazon (AMZN.O), opens new tab, access to one of the largest online shops for electronic goods in Europe and a network of about 1,000 stores in several European countries. About 50,000 people work at the two chains.

The deal, announced on Wednesday, values Ceconomy at 4.60 euros a share and CEO Kai-Ulrich Deissner told Reuters it would likely be completed in the first half of next year.

""It's exactly the right partner at the right time,"" Deissner said. ""Through the partnership, we have access to technologies, world-leading retail expertise, and supply chains that are unparalleled worldwide.""

Ceconomy's management board and supervisory board will recommend accepting the offer to shareholders, it said in a statement. Its Duesseldorf headquarters would remain, it said.

""We will work with the team to strengthen the capabilities, while applying our advanced technology capabilities to accelerate Ceconomy's ongoing transformation,"" said Sandy Xu, CEO of JD.com, in a statement.

""Our goal is to further grow Ceconomy's platform across Europe and create long-term value for customers, employees, investors and local communities.""

The Kellerhals family, the largest single shareholder of Ceconomy with just under 30% of the shares, has accepted an offer for 3.81% of its shares and intends to remain an investor with a stake of approximately 25.35%.

Shareholders Haniel, Beisheim, BC Equities, and Freenet (FNTGn.DE), opens new tab, which together control approximately 27.9% of the shares, intend to sell their shares to JD.com.

""There will be no compulsory redundancies for three years following the closing of the transaction,"" Deissner said,

adding that he does not anticipate any major problems from antitrust authorities.

RATINGS BOOST

Europe is emerging as a hotspot for Chinese deals and investments and the region is expected to attract more money from China driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war, said advisers.

Deals into Europe more than doubled to $8.45 billion in 2024, the highest since 2021, and made up more than a third of all China outbound M&A, according to LSEG data, despite increased scrutiny of foreign investments into the region.

""There's potentially more of an incentive for China and the EU to work closer together on the economic front, in view of the trade policies of the Trump administration,"" said Alan Wang, a global transactions partner at law firm Freshfields.

Ceconomy plans to keep its 23.4% stake in French retailer Fnac Darty (FNAC.PA), opens new tab after the JD.com deal, Deissner said.

""The stake in Fnac Darty will remain. We view it as a long-term strategic option, which we are committed to,"" he said.

Ceconomy last week confirmed it was in advanced negotiations over a potential takeover.

Ceconomy had annual sales of 22.4 billion euros in its 2023/24 financial year, of which 5.1 billion euros were online.

JD.com had looked at an acquisition of British electronics retailer Currys (CURY.L), opens new tab last year.

Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday the takeover could bolster Ceconomy's credit profile.

""A takeover by JD may lead to an upgrade of Ceconomy's rating, benefitting from JD's stronger credit profile, given the latter's market position as one of the largest global e-commerce platforms with $160 billion revenue providing services across retail, technology, logistics, and healthcare sectors,"" it said.

""We believe that the acquisition of Ceconomy would boost JD's presence in Europe through the former's over 1,000 stores under MediaMarkt and Saturn brands, and its online presence (24% of sales),"" it added.

Key Takeaways:

JD.com has reportedly acquired 70% of Hong Kong's Kai Bo supermarket chain, giving it access to the grocer's retail network and property assets The e-commerce giant could use the chain to extend its core Mainland instant retail business overseas, combining its supply chain strengths with Kai Bo's local presence

The fierce real-time retail battle raging on the Chinese mainland could be coming soon to nearby Hong Kong.

That's how things appear, following reports that e-commerce giant JD.Com Inc. JD (9618.HK) has purchased 70% of Hong Kong supermarket chain Kai Bo for HK$4 billion ($512 million). If true, the acquisition could represent a major strategic expansion for JD into Hong Kong's real-time retail market, also known as ""instant retail"" - a growing movement in China as companies race to deliver goods ordered online as quickly as possible.

Completed over four months ago, the deal gives JD.com access to Kai Bo's retail network and real estate assets, according to the reports. It features a transition period clause stipulating that Kai Bo founder Lam Hiu-ngai and the chain's current management team will retain operational control for the next three years. During this period, JD will not seek full operational control to ensure a smooth transition.

Kai Bo's parent companies, Moretide Investments and Hai Feng Food, have reportedly notified their merchant partners about an ongoing ""business transfer."" They plan to restructure operations, transferring the supermarket and wholesale businesses to a newly established Hong Kong entity, Kai Bo Supermarket (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., effective from Aug. 1, according to the reports.

JD has not confirmed the reports, saying only that the actual situation differs from the media coverage and emphasizing that only official announcements are authoritative. Sources have indicated that the actual transaction value may be significantly lower than the figure contained in the media reports.

From hawker to grocery magnate

Founded in 1991, Kai Bo is locally known as a budget friendly neighborhood supermarket chain. The rise of its founder, Lam Hiu-ngai, is the stuff of local business lore. Lam arrived in Hong Kong from the Mainland city of Chaozhou in the 1980s, and started out working as an unlicensed hawker in the city's Chai Wan district. He later co-founded a frozen meat shop with friends before independently establishing Kai Bo. From a single small shop in the city's working class Shau Kei Wan district, Kai Bo has grown into a chain with over 90 outlets and more than 1,000 employees.

For JD, Kai Bo provides a channel to extend its highly efficient and powerful supply chain on the Chinese mainland to Hong Kong, which could also act as a springboard for future additional overseas expansion. JD has direct procurement channels with tens of thousands of Chinese manufacturers. Its self-built warehousing, logistics, and cold chain systems give the e-commerce giant a highly efficient network allowing it to procure, move around and deliver a wide range of products within the vast Mainland market.

As one of a limited number of local supermarket chains in Hong Kong with a major store network and its own delivery capabilities, Kai Bo could serve as an ideal beachhead for JD to bring its supply chain model to the city. Efficient use of its Mainland networks could help JD to bypass import distributors and other intermediaries and directly introduce daily necessities, popular brands, and private label products from the Mainland into Hong Kong.

Such a model would not only offer good prices for Hong Kong consumers but could also open a direct channel for JD's Mainland suppliers to reach overseas retail endpoints, while also acting as a launchpad for markets like Southeast Asia.

The higher-margin Hong Kong market has long been a focus for JD's efforts to internationalize its real-time retail and supply chain capabilities. The company's JD Logistics (2618.HK) arm currently operates fulfillment centers in Hong Kong's Kwun Tong, Kwai Tsing, Sha Tin and Yuen Long districts. It also launched a ""front warehouse"" pilot program in Hong Kong in 2022 to strengthen its capabilities in same-day and next-day delivery services. Its establishment of a cross-border cold chain center in Yuen Long last year also underscores the company's long-term commitment to building up Hong Kong as an offshore warehousing and distribution center.

In China's increasingly heated real-time retail battle, JD is taking a different approach from its peers. Meituan's (3690.HK) focus is a local delivery-based platform that connects convenience stores, supermarkets, and consumers in real-time without extending into the supply chain. Alibaba (BABA.US; 9988.HK) is using a more in-house approach that connects its Ele.me food delivery arm with its Freshippo supermarket chain and Tmall Supermarket, supporting those with its upstream Cainiao Logistics network. But Alibaba has yet to start actively bringing that integrated model to the Hong Kong retail market.

Full chain capabilities

Thus, JD's move with Kai Bo could make it the only Mainland player in Hong Kong with full-chain capabilities, including direct sourcing from factories, cold chain warehousing, online platforms, logistics delivery and a brick-and-mortar store network. Notably, JD has prior experience in Hong Kong through its investment in Qian Dama, a fresh meat and produce chain. With JD as its second-largest shareholder, Qian Dama officially entered Hong Kong in 2018 and now operates around 50 stores locally.

Kai Bo also offers JD.com substantial real estate assets - an important element in a notoriously expensive property market. While Hong Kong shop rents have retreated from recent highs with a local economic slowdown, Kai Bo's real estate will still help JD to reduce its fixed operating costs in the city, while also providing a hedge for the day when Hong Kong's property market starts to recover.

JD's shares fell for two consecutive trading days after the latest reports came out, dropping about 1.3%, reflecting market concerns about the rumored high transaction price. JD currently trades at a depressed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.3 times, well below Meituan's 21.5 times, indicating investors aren't so interested in its story right now.

But that could change if it confirms the Kai Bo acquisition and demonstrates that it can successfully integrate its Mainland supply chains into the Hong Kong retail landscape, with potential to extend that capability to Southeast Asia. Such a move could mark the start of a new globalization campaign for its instant retail business, using a model that could mark a turning point for JD's undervalued stock.

米中貿易摩擦や米国の対中技術輸出規制によって既に打撃を被っている中国経済において、即時配送の価格競争はデフレ圧力を根付かせかねないとして、当局は規制強化も辞さない構えだ。

しかしアリババ(9988.HK), opens new tab、京東集団（ＪＤドットコム）(9618.HK), opens new tab、美団の３大ＥＣはここ数カ月で計約２０００億元（約２８０億ドル）を、無料特典やクーポンなど即時販売の特典に投じることを決めた。

関係筋によると、独占禁止当局の国家市場監督管理総局（ＳＡＭＲ）はサービスの過激化を見かね、先週３社に２度目の呼び出しをかけて「政府の政策に沿った合理的な競争」を求めた。

テック・バズ・チャイナのテクノロジーアナリスト、エド・サンダー氏は「正に今起こっている闘いだが、実際には５年、１０年先の展望と大いに関連している。（プラットフォーム企業は）この闘いが社の存亡を決しかねないと考えている」と述べた。

人工知能（ＡＩ）と自動倉庫の採用によって即時配送の収益性は今後ますます高まり、従来のＥＣを食い荒らすほどになると同氏は見ている。

競争の数例を挙げると、アリババは１時間以内に配達する朝食の料金をカバーするクーポンを配布し、美団はお茶を無料で提供、京東集団傘下のＪＤテイクアウェイは１１元以上の注文で１０元のクーポンを付与している。

アリババ、京東、美団はコメント要請に応じなかった。

＜有害な競争＞

中国当局は通常、健全で合理的な市場の発展を害すると判断した慣行に対し、継続的に強硬姿勢を採る。企業がそれに抗うのは珍しい。

国営の新華社通信は２３日の社説で、即時配送は「無料の買い物」だとして、その悪影響を明確に指摘。「表面上はプラットフォーム企業が『価格戦争』で即時配送市場を争っている構図だが、その本質は特典を付けて『バブル市場』を生み出すことだ」とし、「率直に言って勝者はいない」と切り込んだ。

中国経済は今年上半期に５．３％の成長を遂げたが、小売売上高の伸びは５月の６．４％から６月には４．８％に減速しており、先行きが危ぶまれる。

またＡＮＺのエコノミストらの推計では、中国の消費者物価指数は今年０．１％、生産者物価指数は３％、それぞれ低下する見通しだ。予想通りなら、２００９年以来初めて年間でデフレとなる。

中欧国際工商学院の経済学教授、バラ・ラマサミー氏は「価格戦争は決して企業の利益にはならない。消費者は当然利益を得るが、マクロ経済の観点からは価格期待が低下し続ける」とし、「中国で起きている競争のレベルは現実離れしており、時には有害ですらある。公共の利益のために政府の介入が不可欠だ」と語った。

＜即時配送ビジネスの魅力＞

関係筋によると、規制当局は２５日の会議で問題点の１つとして、無料で付いてくる飲食物の食品ロスを挙げた。

テック・バズ・チャイナのサンダー氏は「規制当局は、あらゆる点から不満を抱いている。間違いなく不満なのは、多くのハイテク企業が、長期的な効果ゼロの消費者向けの割引を乱発して資金を浪費していることだ」と語る。

しかし新型コロナ禍以来、個人消費低迷による成長鈍化に苦しむＥＣ企業にとって、即時配送ビジネスの魅力は無視できない。

中国国際貿易経済合作研究院のデータによると、即時配送は従来のＥＣに比べ約２．５倍のスピードで成長しており、売上高は２０３０年までに２兆元を超える見通しだ。

消費者は低価格を享受できるかもしれないが、ＥＣの出店社はソーシャルメディア上で、価格競争によって利ざやがほぼゼロになったと不満を漏らしている。レストラン経営者は収益性の高い対面注文が減ったと嘆く。

外食データ調査機関ＮＣＢＤの創設者、ワン・ホンドン氏は「規制の観点から、当局は一般的には競争を歓迎しており、最も反対しているのは独占だ」と指摘。「従って配送戦争が完全に停止する可能性は低いが、レストラン実店舗での飲食への影響など、課題の一部には対処しそうだ」との見方を示した。

8787390729,https://gcn.com/softbank-aims-to-lead-as-asi-platform-provider/811/,SoftBank aims to lead as 'artificial super intelligence' platform provider,"Son likened his aim to the position of dominant technology platform providers such as Microsoft MSFT.O, Amazon AMZN.O, and Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, which benefit from a ""winner takes all"" dynamic. At previous public appearances, Son has described artificial superintelligence as AI technology that is able to exceed human capabilities by a factor of 10,000.

SoftBank has returned to making the aggressive investments that made Son's name, such as an early bet on Alibaba 9988.HK, but that at times spectacularly backfired, like its massive investment in failed shared office provider WeWork. Its AI-related deals this year include acquiring U.S. semiconductor designer Ampere for $6.5 billion and the underwriting of up to $40 billion of new investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Son said SoftBank's total agreed investment in OpenAI now stood at $32 billion since first investing in Autumn 2024, and that he regretted not investing earlier. He also said he expected OpenAI to eventually go public. ""I'm all in on OpenAI,"" Son said. SoftBank had owned around 5% of Nvidia NVDA.O until it sold the stake in 2019, before ChatGPT generated a surge in AI interest at the end of 2022.

Nvidia now dominates AI chipmaking and has become one of the world's most valuable companies. Son's latest spending spree follows years of retrenchment after the high-growth tech startups into which SoftBank had invested billions of dollars through its Vision Fund investment vehicles crashed in value from 2022.

Fortunes changed again when SoftBank raised some $5 billion listing chip designer Arm in September 2023. The rise in the British firm's share price since has boosted the group's assets, against which SoftBank can take out debt to fund new investment.

Son said SoftBank was committed to prudent investment and that, throughout the peaks and troughs, SoftBank has maintained the financial resources and user base such that it can take risks at times. Earlier in June, it raised $4.8 billion from the sale of some shares in T-Mobile TMUS.O.

ASI, or otherwise known as Artificial Superintelligence, is a very advanced form of Artificial Intelligence. It possesses cognitive abilities that reach far beyond those of even the brightest of human minds. ASI differs quite extensively from current AI, or alternatively called Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). The design of ANI allows it to perform specific tasks. ASI, on the other hand, will have the capability to generalize knowledge and be able to apply it across various fields. These fields can include arts, science, emotional intelligence, as well as mathematics. With ASI advances still in its early days, it would be interesting to note how the vision of the company and the CEO will combine with this.",eng,Global Current News,2025-07-26T22:12:23Z,2025-07-26,22:12:23

China wants to help coordinate global efforts to regulate fast-evolving AI technology and share the country's advances, Premier Li Qiang told the annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.

President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday released an AI blueprint aiming to vastly expand US AI exports to allies in a bid to maintain the American edge over China in the critical technology.

Li did not name the United States but appeared to refer to Washington's efforts to stymie China's advances in AI, warning that the technology risked becoming the ""exclusive game"" of a few countries and companies.

China wants AI to be openly shared and for all countries and companies to have equal rights to use it, Li said, adding that Beijing was willing to share its development experience and products with other countries, particularly the ""Global South."" The Global South refers to developing, emerging or lower-income countries, mostly in the southern hemisphere.

How to regulate AI's growing risks was another concern, Li said, adding that bottlenecks included an insufficient supply of AI chips and restrictions on talent exchange.

""Overall global AI governance is still fragmented. Countries have great differences particularly in terms of areas such as regulatory concepts, institutional rules,"" he said. ""We should strengthen coordination to form a global AI governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible.""

The three-day Shanghai conference brings together industry leaders and policymakers at a time of escalating technological competition between China and the United States - the world's two largest economies - with AI emerging as a key battleground.

Washington has imposed export restrictions on advanced technology to China, including the most high-end AI chips made by companies such as Nvidia NVDA.O and chipmaking equipment, citing concerns that the technology could enhance China's military capabilities.

Despite these restrictions, China has continued making AI breakthroughs that have drawn close scrutiny from US officials.

China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu told a roundtable of representatives from over 30 countries, including Russia, South Africa, Qatar, South Korea, and Germany, that China wanted the organization to promote pragmatic cooperation in AI and was considering putting its headquarters in Shanghai.

The foreign ministry released online an action plan for global AI governance, inviting governments, international organisations, enterprises and research institutions to work together and promote international exchanges including through a cross-border open source community.

The government-sponsored AI conference typically attracts major industry players, government officials, researchers and investors.

截至7月25日收盘，申通快递（002468.SZ）涨停，报15.14元/股，年初至今股价涨超五成。

菜鸟的战略取舍：为何此时出售丹鸟？

丹鸟物流由菜鸟于2019年左右布局，是菜鸟旗下业务之一的菜鸟速递运营主体，主要从事国内品质快递及逆向物流服务，在国内通过自营网络为天猫、天猫超市、淘宝等电商平台及消费者提供半日达、次晨达、送货上门等履约服务。2024年度及2025年前4月，丹鸟日均业务量均在400万单以上。

此次公告中披露了丹鸟物流最新财务细节。丹鸟物流去年实现营收123.51亿元，实现净利润盈利2011.54万元；今年前4月实现营收为29.65亿元，净利润为亏损2.34亿元。

据阿里巴巴集团5月发布的最新财报显示，2025财年（截至2025年3月31日止）菜鸟集团收入为1012.72亿元，同比增长2%，主要由跨境物流履约解决方案的收入增长所带动，部分被其电商业务承担部分物流平台职责而导致的国内物流服务收入下降所抵销。菜鸟集团在2025财年的经调整EBITA为3.02亿元，同比下降78%，主要是由于跨境物流履约解决方案的利润下降所致。

申通在公告中解释称，丹鸟物流出现亏损，主要由于起网时间较短，业务量尚在爬坡增长阶段。前期投入及相关成本、费用未能显著摊薄，导致规模效应未能充分发挥，盈利能力相对较弱，同时今年前四月，受到行业传统淡季，业务量较少及行业价格下行等因素影响。

丹鸟业绩数据，来源于前述公告

这笔看似突然的交易，或是菜鸟战略聚焦的延续。

据悉，此次出售的丹鸟物流在菜鸟业务中占比不大。近年来，菜鸟将重心转向国际物流与科技业务，其主营业务已涵盖全球供应链、跨境物流、海外本地快递、物流科技、物流园区等板块。

今年1月，网上曾传出""菜鸟分拆""的消息，当时澎湃新闻记者向阿里和菜鸟内部消息人士证实，为假消息。据悉，目前菜鸟仅对部分平台物流业务做生产关系调整，菜鸟主体物流业务未发生改变，将继续大力发展全球快递、供应链和物流科技等。当时，有接近阿里人士称，过去一年来，菜鸟支持阿里电商的平台型业务都在与电商紧密配合，团队联合办公已经很长时间，最新的变化只是在此基础上的自然调整，有助于阿里电商业务协同发展。

业内人士分析，国际物流市场客单价高、利润空间大，且能更好发挥科技能力的边际效应，是菜鸟未来的核心发力方向。而丹鸟在菜鸟业务中占比不大，出售丹鸟可让菜鸟更专注于国际物流这一""蓝海""市场。

一方面，跨境电商持续增长、中国品牌加速出海，使得跨境物流、全球供应链和海外本地配送的需求不断攀升。另一方面，全球电商物流服务供给不足。商家选择时，要么依赖分散的货代和区域性网络，但可能信息化和协同程度不足，要么只得选择传统国际物流，但普遍价格高昂，且难以匹配电商的高频、灵活和性价比需求。

2023年6月28日，菜鸟集团宣布推出自营快递业务""菜鸟速递""，当时业内解读为此举对标顺丰、京东两大现有的自营快递巨头。当前，距离推出自营快递菜鸟速递已时隔两年多，在此期间菜鸟也在陆续剥离小业务，过去一年明确了""国际物流+科技""的战略定位，并全力推动市场化发展。

2024年3月底，菜鸟上市之路中断。阿里巴巴集团宣布撤回物流子公司菜鸟智慧物流网络有限公司在港交所提交的上市申请，并要约收购菜鸟少数股东的股权和员工已归属的股权。收购涉及金额达到37.5亿美元。当时，阿里巴巴董事局主席蔡崇信就指出，将加大对菜鸟全球物流网络的投入。菜鸟此后也多次强调，未来将紧密协同淘天集团和阿里巴巴数字商业集团，提升服务体验。

申通的进击：收购丹鸟意欲何为？

对于这场收购，申通快递在投资者交流中明确了多重战略考量。

首先是响应行业供给侧改革需求。近年来，快递行业业务量持续增长，2024年累计完成1750.8亿件，同比增长21.5%，但行业平均单票价格却同比下降6.33%至8.01元，""内卷式""竞争问题凸显。国家邮政局近期也强调要反对""内卷""、整治末端服务质量，而此次收购正是申通推动行业高质量发展的举措。

其次是切入高端市场，完善业务矩阵。申通在公告中指出，丹鸟物流主打国内品质快递及逆向物流，在揽派端上门率、时效性上具备优势，2025年前四月综合单票收入显著高于申通的2.02元。通过收购，申通可快速切入高端配送市场，抓住区域配送、即时零售等新兴场景的机遇，丰富业务产品。交易完成后，公司产品结构、单票价格等均有望得到优化提升。

更重要的是，这是申通提升服务品质、打造差异化优势的关键一步。申通快递总裁王文彬在今年6月底举办的申通快递开放日活动上承诺""三年内申通快递的体验必须要做到第一，这是信心，也是我们的决心。""

而丹鸟的自营网络与高品质服务能力，正是申通对标顺丰、京东等自营快递巨头的重要筹码。业内人士指出，此举并非简单的规模叠加，而是战略卡位。既规避了自建高端网络周期长、见效慢的风险，又能锁定即时零售带来的品质快递红利，有望为申通开辟第二增长曲线。

此外，公告指出，本次交易条款设置中，从5月起至交割日的盈利归申通，若产生亏损由交易对方补偿。随着快递行业逐步进入旺季，丹鸟物流的经营情况有望好转。叠加交易完成后双方产生的融合效应，未来标的公司盈利能力有望得到进一步改善，并相应提升上市公司整体盈利能力和可持续经营能力。

据财报显示，2024年申通快递实现营业收入471.7亿元，同比增长15.3%，其中快递服务收入466.5亿元，同比增长19.3%，创历史新高；实现归母净利润10.4亿元，同比大增205.2%；2025年一季度实现营业收入119.99亿元创历史同期新高，同比增长18.43%；归母净利润2.36亿元，同比增长24.04%。

此次交易完成后，丹鸟物流将正式纳入申通体系，而菜鸟则可更专注于国际物流与科技赛道。在行业反""内卷""、重体验的大背景下，这场收购或将成为快递业格局重塑的重要注脚。不过，交易仍需通过市场监督管理局的经营者集中审查，后续业务整合效果也有待时间检验，快递江湖的新一轮博弈才刚刚开始。",zho,东方财富网,2025-07-26T00:44:57Z,2025-07-26,00:44:57

2025-07-786554296,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/chinese-e-commerce-leaders-brush-off-regulatory-risk-continue-instant-retail-2025-07-25/,Chinese e-commerce leaders brush off regulatory risk to continue 'instant retail' price war,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING, July 25(Reuters) - China's largest e-commerce platforms show no signs of halting an ""instant retail"" price war unusual in its resilience to state criticism, indicating the almost existential importance placed on instant retail as the future of e-commerce.

Their fight in instant retail, where delivery can be as quick as half an hour, risks the wrath of authorities not averse to crackdowns and wary that aggressive price-cutting could entrench deflationary pressure in an economy already under fire from U.S. tariffs and restrictions on tech exports to China.

Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab, JD.com (9618.HK), opens new tab and Meituan have pledged almost 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) combined to subsidise one-hour delivery in recent months, leading to customers who order beverages, for instance, effectively receiving them for free.

So extreme is the strategy that the trio was summoned for the second time last week to the State Administration of Market Regulation which called for ""rational competition"" aligned with the government agenda, said a person familiar with the matter.

""It's really a battle that takes place now but is much more related to the expectations for five to 10 years down the road. (The platforms believe this is) life or death, it might mean the future or the lack of a future for their company,"" said Ed Sander, tech analyst at Tech Buzz China.

The adoption of artificial intelligence and automated warehouses will make instant retail increasingly profitable to the extent it will cannibalise conventional e-commerce, he said.

Examples of instant retail and attendant price war include coupons from Alibaba covering the cost of breakfast delivered within 60 minutes, or from Meituan offering free tea. JD Takeaway offers 10 yuan coupons for orders as little as 11 yuan.

Alibaba, JD.com and Meituan did not respond to requests for comment.

TOXIC COMPETITION

Authorities in China typically take a sustained and firm-handed approach toward practices they deem unfavourable to healthy and rational market development, making dissent rare.

State media agency Xinhua was unequivocal in a Wednesday editorial about the negative impact of ""zero yuan purchases"".

""On the surface, platform companies engage in 'price wars' to compete for the instant retail market, but their essence is to use subsidies to give birth to a 'bubble market',"" the editorial read. ""To put it bluntly, there is no winner.""

China's $19 trillion economy grew 5.3% in the first half of 2025. Hinting at what may be to come, however, retail sales growth slowed to 4.8% in June from 6.4% in May.

Moreover, ANZ economists estimated a 0.1% decline this year in the consumer price index and 3% decline in the producer price index, for what would be the first annual deflation since 2009.

""A price war is never in the interest of businesses. Consumers gain of course, but from a macroeconomic point of view (it leads) price expectations to keep decreasing,"" said economics professor Bala Ramasamy at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.

""The level of competition we have in China has become unrealistic and at times toxic. Government intervention has become necessary for the sake of the greater good,"" he said.

INSTANT APPEAL

The regulatory attention is different to that given to the electric vehicle sector, where price wars stemmed in part from overcapacity. One issued raised by the regulator at the Friday meeting was food waste from unconsumed zero-yuan orders, said the person familiar with the matter, who was not authorised to speak with media and so declined to be identified.

""Everything points in the direction that they (regulators) are not happy with this, definitely not happy with a lot of tech companies just burning money by handing out all of those consumer discounts that will have no long-term effect,"" Sander said.

The appeal of instant retail battle is difficult to ignore for e-commerce firms that have struggled to unlock growth in the consumer spending slowdown since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The instant retail sector is growing around 2.5 times faster than conventional e-commerce and is set to surpass 2 trillion yuan in sales by 2030, showed data from the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.

While consumers may enjoy the low prices, merchants complain on social media that price wars all but eliminate profit margins and restaurateurs bemoan a fall in profitable in-person custom.

""From a regulatory perspective, authorities are generally in favour of competition, what they oppose most is monopoly,"" said catering industry analyst Wang Hongdong, founder of catering data research institute NCBD.
